Vermicomposting involves utilizing organic materials like cow dung and the creature known as catchway to create nutrient-rich tea for plants. This vermi tea is produced by maintening a moist environment for the catchway to release saliva into the cow dung, which is then squeezed after several days into water, turning it into a liquid fertilizer. 
  
  Another method, vermi-wash, involves housing catchways with cow dung inside pots to produce plant growth hormones. These hormones are collected in a droplet form containing catchway saliva, sweat, and urine, and used on plants.
  
  Additionally, vermi composting is employed to generate manure in LDP (low-density polyethylene) bags, with cow dung and the reproductive increase of the catchway, resulting in a product that is both used for farming and sold in the market.
  
  Furthermore, the community is utilizing Light Trap Santar, a pest control method that attracts and captures insects using bulb light, subsequently using the water with the dead insects as fertilizer.
  
  They also employ a technique called Bhu Nadev Takneev, where manure is produced from organic waste in covered pits, and a poly mulching technique to protect crops from weeds, involving cutting polythene into circles around the base of plants.
  
  The hard work of these women has not only enhanced agricultural yields but also provided a foundation for financial stability, as evidenced by their successful loan repayment record and coordination with local financial institutions. The increase in agricultural production has also created a market link with Aajeevika Fresh that transports fresh vegetables while promoting the production of organic manure.

This method emphasizes control over planting density and distance between plants. The approach originates from African agricultural practices and benefits from continuous experimentation and adaptation.
  
  One key aspect of the method is the precise spacing of plants. Planting is done at intervals of 25 centimeters to ensure equal distribution and efficient use of space. This technique reduces the seed requirement significantly. While traditional broadcasting methods need 30-40 kilograms of seed per acre, this new method requires only 3-5 kilograms.
  
  Farmers prepare the field for this method within 10-12 days before planting. Today, specific agrichemicals are available to optimize growth, like the prime argens Vidisarth. These chemicals, also referred to by various brand names, are applied before planting to minimize excessive water usage. Leveling the land is an essential part of this process to ensure uniformity across the field.
  
  Another integral practice in this method involves the use of single super phosphate fertilizer. Applied at the time of planting, it must be distributed evenly, with 70 kilograms being the quantity specified for one acre.

Digital Green,Seed Germination Test in Wheat Hindi ASA MP,https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQ4NUMqRD-g,TQ4NUMqRD-g,TQ4NUMqRD-g.mp3,hindi,"Germination of wheat is the focus of a farmer's agricultural activities, involving a specific technique to ensure proper growth. The process involves soaking seeds in water using sacks, a method that helps with wheat germination. The sacks are wetted and seeds are placed within them in a deliberate, orderly manner to facilitate accurate counting and to monitor germination rates. The seeds are initially separated into precise counts, then evenly deposited onto the sacks.
  
  The rationale for organizing seeds systematically is to count the emerging seedlings, also referred to as ""jassi,"" and to determine the efficiency of germination from the sack. The sack with seeds is maintained in an appropriate condition, which includes regular wetting to keep the environment conducive for germination. Observations are made on the wheat's germination rates, and based on these rates, decisions are made regarding sowing density. Specifically, when germination rates are between 70 and 80 percent, seeds are deemed ready for sowing.
  
  If the germination rate is slightly lower, at 60 to 70 percent, the sowing rate is adjusted accordingly. In such cases, the amount of seed to be sown per acre might be increased to ensure adequate plant density and coverage. This careful monitoring and adjustment ensure that farmers achieve a healthy and abundant crop yield.
  
  The intended message to fellow farmers is the importance of adopting this germination technique to improve crop yields. By studying the germination process and adjusting sowing practices based on germination rates, farmers are encouraged to attain fruitful harvests.

Down To Earth,Baranaja: A Climate resilient farming practice that produces nutritious foods in Uttarakhand,https://youtu.be/0aN4ZuHMckU?si=Am1NdoOAtpFmVfTg,0aN4ZuHMckU,0aN4ZuHMckU.mp3,hindi,"In the study of agriculture regarding a certain species referred to as ""Naz,"" it is noted that this group includes 12 types of grains. These grains are part of a mixed crop traditionally grown in the Kharif season. Among these, ""Mandua,"" also known as Ragi, is prominent, along with crops such as Amaranth and Kuttu. The agricultural practice also involves the cultivation of various pulses, such as Rajma, Uddh, Moong, Jahat, Bhat, Navrangi, Ragdwas, Rash, and Krakraki Dals.
  
  There is a scientific relationship between the cultivation methods and the health of the land. Certain grains like Mandua and Ramdana require more energy from the soil, but the introduction of pulses in the rotation is observed to improve soil fertility. There is also a growth pattern, particularly with Ramdana and Mandua, which benefits from intercropping with crops like bael that can climb or wrap around the main crop.
  
  The crop rotation cycle occurs as follows: after the Barrenza harvest, planting occurs in June, followed by a harvest in September and October. The land, characterized as dry and appreciative (referred to by a local term), is left fallow for 3-4 months post-harvest to rest. Different crop varieties are rotatedÃ¢â‚¬â€the Mandoya or Barnaza will not be replanted immediately, and instead, crops like Jahangora and Kani will be sown.
  
  Challenges such as erratic weather patterns have disrupted traditional farming rhythms that lasted 25-30 years, leading to issues in the last 10-15 years. Regardless of weather variations, certain crops may still be affected, and the presence of wild animals can also influence crop success. Bears, for instance, are drawn to Mandwa and leave other crops like pulses and Amaranth undisturbed.
  
  Amaranth is particularly sought after nationwide; its local name indicates its significance in regional diets, especially during festivals. The focus on certain grains is increasing due to their health benefits, including for individuals with diabetes. Efforts from government entities include price regulation and providing bonuses to support these agricultural practices.","Exploration of diverse crop cultivation practices emphasizing the synergy between grain and pulse growth, alongside the impacts of seasonal patterns and environmental factors on agricultural yields.","grains, mixed crop, Kharip, Mandua, Ragi, Amaranth, Kuttu, pulses, crop cycle, soil restoration, dry land, agriculture sustainability, seasonal harvesting, wildlife interaction, demand, local markets, dietary recommendations, government support, price regulation, disease management"
Down To Earth,How can a small farmer earn Rs 15 lakh from multilayer farming?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyOzeO6fQwI,FyOzeO6fQwI,FyOzeO6fQwI.mp3,hindi,"Multi-layer farming is practiced on approximately 2.5 acres of land, with crops layered at various heights; for example, ginger is planted underground, ivy gourd at a certain height, and papaya at eight feet. The estimated cost of establishing multi-layer farming is 1 to 1.5 lakh per acre, with this investment expected to last for five years, resulting in an annual cost of around 30,000 per acre. The additional cost for addressing plant diseases for the entire plot is approximately 1 to 1.5 lakh annually. Including labor and other expenses, the total expenditure can reach 3.5-4 lakh. Gross profits from the farm can amount to 15-16 lakh, with additional income from verticals like milk and vermicomposting contributing to around 12-15 lakh seedlings.
  
  Leafy vegetables are planted as surface crops along with ginger, offering benefits such as rapid ground cover that suppresses weeds, thus reducing the need for repeated weeding. This approach also promotes soil health by preventing soil erosion and allowing air to circulate, benefiting the underground crops. A semi-controlled environment is created by constructing structures with bamboo and bass for shading, ensuring the plants receive the necessary sunlight and protection from harsh conditions like hail. Locally adapted, native seeds demonstrate strong resistance to adverse conditions, support extended fruiting periods, and require less water due to the natural mulching effect created by the multi-layer canopy.
  
  Pest control is managed using natural methods, such as colored traps that attract flying insects. The farm produces around 40 tonnes of vermicompost, using 4-5 tonnes and selling the surplus at a rate of 500 rupees per quintal, generating an additional income of 1.5-2.5 lakh rupees. The farming model is cost-effective and suitable for marginal farmers with 1-2 acres of land, allowing them to run the farm with family labor. Dedicated to promoting healthy eating and sustainable agriculture practices, the farm organizes events to share knowledge on natural farming, experimenting with 15-16 different models to determine suitable crop combinations for multi-layer farming.","Multi-layer farming enhances yield, sustainability, and income through strategic crop placement and resource management, minimizing environmental impact and maximizing land use.","multi-layer farming, ginger, ivy gourd, papaya, cost estimation, vermicomposting, bamboo structure, crop resistance, harvest cycle, natural farming models"

Down To Earth,Why farmers in Uttarakhand prefer indigenous and local seeds over hybrids?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqX7hR5u99U,bqX7hR5u99U,bqX7hR5u99U.mp3,hindi,"In 2015, discussions among agricultural experts highlighted a preference among farmers for traditional seeds over newer varieties due to their resilience to variable climatic conditions. These local seeds can withstand diverse weather patterns, such as excessive dryness or rainfall, even with minimal maintenance. Farmers employ organic practices, avoiding chemical additives and pesticides in their cultivation.
  
  Extensive trials with various seed types concluded that indigenous seeds outperform others regarding adaptability to changing weather. These seeds have been part of successful agricultural practices for many years, necessitating their continued use. They yield not only crops but also pulses and lentils.
  
  Women play a vital role in agriculture, particularly in the preservation and utilization of these seeds. With men often absent due to work in urban areas, women manage the farmlands, including sowing, harvesting, and selecting the best seeds for future seasons. They incorporate Walnut leaves in the preservation process to protect against pests and ensure the seeds' longevity, maintaining their viability for up to three years.
  
  Storage of the harvest employs traditional wooden boxes known locally, which have the inherent property of absorbing moisture, thus preserving the quality of the stored seeds or grains.
  
  In this region, agriculture is complemented by animal husbandry, with livestock providing essential organic manure, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. Crops grown with organic fertilizers offer quality fodder, preferred by the livestock over fodder from hybrid seeds.
  
  The local seeds, central to sustainable and eco-friendly agricultural practices, can grow with minimal effort and potentially yield better results than hybrid varieties when given more attention. They are well-suited to local conditions, the crop cycle, and extreme weather events.
  
  Communities value the superior taste and quality of food derived from traditional crops. Locally produced rice, for example, is favored for its distinctive aroma and flavor, as is the case with other traditional produce like coriander.","Sustainability and resilience in agriculture are championed through the preference for traditional seeds, which are better suited for local climates and organic farming practices.","traditional seeds, farming methods, resilient, climatic conditions, organic farming, women's role, seed preservation, livestock, sustainable agriculture, food security"

Similar events were reported in other areas, reflecting a pattern of extreme weather including seasonal rain, drought, and locust attacks from 2020. The United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP26) was hosted in the United Kingdom in late October and early November the previous year. Just prior to the conference, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) highlighted that India faced substantial financial losses due to natural disasters in 2020, being one of the hottest years on record, with significant impacts from cyclones and above-average rainfall in certain regions causing damage to agriculture. Nearly 50,40,000 hectares of crops were destroyed by November 25, 2021, affecting various agro-climatic zones.
  
  Some reports by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) predict changes in climate will alter harvest patterns, potentially decreasing the production of rice, wheat, and maize by the end of the century. Several districts are categorized as highly sensitive or sensitive to climate changes. Extreme weather events have led to crop losses on millions of hectares, with 2016 and 2020 being particularly devastating, coinciding with record heat.
  
  Excessive rainfall affected southern states, causing significant damage to land and crops, with considerable financial implications in crop loss extrapolated from data provided for past years. Farmers, who predominantly hold less than 2 hectares of land, struggle against these weather extremes due to inadequate compensation and insurance mechanisms.

Down To Earth,Aquaponics (एक्वापॉनिक्स) can be a profitable agriculture (खेती) technique for Indian farmers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=018rIAPkTH4,018rIAPkTH4,018rIAPkTH4.mp3,hindi,"The individual earns income from fish and vegetables. They are involved in an agricultural method where fish feed and pesticides, described as expensive medicines, are not a cost they incur. This method allows for water conservation ranging between 90% to 95%, advantageous in regions facing water scarcity issues, such as in farming contexts analogous to India.
  
  The agricultural method in question combines aquaculture and hydroponics to create a soilless cultivation system known as Eco Ponics. In this setup, fish tanks are used, wherein fish produce ammonia as waste after being fed. Ammonia is hazardous to fish if not removed from the water, leading to potential fatality. The fish-tank water, containing the ammonia, is cycled through the plants planted in beds. This cycling process involves mechanical and biofiltration stages where the water's solid waste is filtered out and ammonia is converted to nitrates. Plants use these nitrates for growth. Afterward, the water undergoes deep water culture, primarily for cultivating leafy vegetables that absorb the remaining nitrates, aiding in their growth, before the water is recycled back to the fish tanks.
  
  The capacity of the fish tank must be determined by the number of fish and the frequency of water replenishment. In addition, the fish waste production rate dictates the conversion requirements of the system. Once the farm is established, a bed nursery with a mixture of cocoa peat, vermiculite, and perlite is created for initial seed planting until the plants are ready to be transplanted into the beds. A variety of plants including basil, lettuce, coriander, beans, okra, tomato, pepper, and cucumber can be grown, but root vegetables require a different technique, aeroponics. Tilapia is recommended for tropical climates due to its resilience to water quality changes.
  
  Eco ponics generates two to three times more produce compared to conventional farming, combining both vegetable and fish yields, thereby optimizing resources. Multiple cropping within eco ponics can increase profitability. In extreme weather conditions, the water in eco ponics acts as a buffer to temperature variations, compared to direct atmospheric conditions. Farming can be conducted in various environments, with protection levels varying against potential insect and virus threats.","Aquaponics integrates fish and plant cultivation, conserving water and enabling sustainable, synergistic food production.","Eco Ponics, Aqua Culture, Hydroponics, ammonia, nitrates, mechanical filters, bio filters, deep water culture, Tilapia fish, multiple cropping"

It suggests passing 500 milliliters of water between two trees, specifically in the furrows, during the rainy season when temperatures are cooler. The process described involves watering the soil thoroughly so that the water is fully integrated with the soil.
  
  A substance called ""miracle water"" is mentioned, which reportedly takes six months to freeze. This implies that the water is used on a semi-annual basis, with specific reference to two six-month periods. There is an emphasis on the need to distribute the water evenly between two trees on a flat surface.
  
  The text introduces a notion of using brown water on a plane, but it's not clear whether ""plane"" refers to an aircraft or a flat area of land. There's an explicit instruction against construction on this field and the indication that three liters of water will be required for the entire upcoming year, with an emphasis on the need to increase the soil for the following year.
  
  Looking ahead to the second year, the text increases the requirement to four liters of water and suggests it will take a full year to acquire the designation or tag associated with this process. The budget does not seem to be a consideration for this four-liter allocation.
  
  Five years into the future, the text hints that the water's characteristics will become known, but insists that it needs to be retained or conserved, particularly during the rainy season.

A Subash Pale farming technique is currently used on a 15-guntha plot. Presently, the farm has an intercropping system where carrots, fenugreek, coriander, and maize have been planted alongside Kali crops, with an upcoming harvest anticipated. Mustard has also been sown, with the plants now growing approximately two feet high after eight days. Employing a white cover on the crops' roots is a water-efficient method that promotes better growth, which has been implemented.
  
  To protect the crops and ensure root development, a mixture of jaggery, gumitra, and buttermilk is sprayed from the fourth day of Jumin. Following this, Jumamrug is applied weekly from the fifth day, and Agniasar is sprayed twice a week. Due to a higher pest invasion, particularly on the chili crop, neem oil along with Agniasar is sprayed twice weekly. The crops have varying maturation times: chili production is expected to start from the day of sari, carrot harvesting begins after 90 days, fenugreek removal will occur by this time, and maize will be ready after 100 days. 
  
  Labor requirements for maintaining the farm are mentioned, with 15 laborers every 8-8 days. The anticipated revenue from otter milan and chili is roughly 3 to 3.5 lakh rupees over a span of 2.5 months. Post-harvest, profit from bananas is expected to be at least 40,000 rupees annually, and the total yearly revenue from various crops is estimated to be around four lakh rupees.
  
  The narrative concludes with a promotion of Subash Pale farming as a productive and sustainable agricultural practice, encouraging farmers to adopt intercropping rather than relying on a single crop.

Weather anomalies with unexpected cloudbursts and smoky rain led to flooding, disrupting traditional planting schedules, preventing the sowing of wheat in November as is customary. Once conditions improved, wheat was subsequently planted in January instead.
  
  Wheat cultivation requires specific amounts of nutrients for optimal growth, ranging from 15 to 30 ounces, and up to 37 ounces for certain products. There's mention of a photo of a wheat plant that is 35 days old, and questions raised about the effects of particular conditions that may occur during the ninth stage of the plant's growth cycle on the wheat harvesting process and its readiness, including querying whether it's in the ear-emerging or grain-filling stages.
  
  Discussion of temperature requirements for the crop suggests potential complications due to untimely sowing, which may affect yield. There is also a mention of a traditional variety of wheat, which is an indigenous 100% native variety, celebrated for being suited to specific uses and requiring less chemical fertilizer when compared to modern cultivars.
  
  The indigenous variety appears to be well-suited for certain dishes and is noted for its agricultural adaptability and higher market price despite producing grain amounts comparable to chemical fertilizers.

Without such coverage, which protects soil from erosion and helps maintain moisture levels, the creation of humus would be impeded. Additionally, plants require a supply of fertilizers to feed their roots, which are essential for robust growth. 
  
  The method of plastic mulching, which involves covering the soil with sheets of plastic, is contested in the given context. This practice is implied to hinder the natural process of humus formation and is viewed as not beneficial for the soil. Concerns are raised about what happens to the soil underneath the plastic and the effects on soil health. 
  
  There is also an implicit critique of the mandate to use chemical fertilizers like urea, with a suggestion that this is not legally required and could be seen as a conventional but flawed agricultural practice. 
  
  The discourse urges reconsideration of current agricultural methods, emphasizing the importance of natural processes and the role of organic substances in fostering healthy soil ecosystems, as opposed to synthetic interventions. The need for innovation in soil and crop management practices is suggested, underlining the relationship between soil health and plant nutrition.","Humus is essential for fertile soil, created by organic matter and agricultural practices, with a caution against the improper use of plastic mulching in farming.","humus, organic carbs, organic nutrition, soil covering, crop residue, forest remains, plastic mulching, fertilizers, urea, phosphorus"

The leaf is set to function as Bhagdi Sothi 67 Bhagdi, which appears to be related to a drainage process that includes removing a drain and working along both sides of it. Milk is associated with the process described. Previously, Sak Mein Bel and Vargiyah were discussed, and the text mentions encountering something called Ghalan, questioning whether it will produce humus.
  
  Humus is highlighted as drawing water from the air; specifically, one kilogram of humus can absorb six liters of water overnight. This humus concept benefits the plants by providing them water, even when the ground doesn't appear wet. The text describes a scenario where the soil beneath the surface is moist without apparent watering, suggesting that the moisture was absorbed from the air.
  
  There is a mention of a regular process that involves removing weeds in the afternoon and allowing them to dry during the day. The next morning, the soil is still dry on the surface but moist underneath.
  
  The text also discusses the concept of a 'water budget,' wherein 90% aromatic water is mentioned, implying a significant retention of moisture in the soil through a strategy that includes mulching to save water moisture in the ground without the need for additional watering from above. This strategy leads to an efficient use of water, with implications for saving large amounts of water in agricultural practices, which can be reallocated elsewhere if necessary.

Avocado cultivation is gaining traction due to multiple factors, including health consciousness among consumers. Avocados are nutrient-dense, offering weight loss benefits, eye health improvement, digestion enhancement, bone strengthening, and potential effectiveness against cancer according to doctors, which maintains high market demand.
  
  Avocado growing is suitable in hot climates and should be avoided in cold regions. Originating in South America, avocados thrive in hot zone climates, requiring over 60% moisture content for optimal yield. They can withstand temperatures around 5 degrees Celsius but not lower, as it can damage their nutrient content, and temperatures around 40 degrees Celsius can harm the blossom and fruit.
  
  For avocado farming, red soil is not ideal due to inadequate pie formation and low clay content. A preferable soil type has a higher clay content and strong planting potential. Ideal soil pH for avocado cultivation ranges from five to six. Avocado trees from seeds take 5-6 years to start fruiting, and different varieties change color as they mature.
  
  Nutritionally, avocados are rich in fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins A, C, E, potassium, and particularly high in vitamin B. They can generate substantial returns for farmers, enhancing both their financial wellbeing and health of consumers.

Prior crops in the field have included sugarcane, chillies, potatoes, gram, mustard, and coriander, with plans to continue with a similar crop rotation.
  
  The sugarcane planting method involves a ring fit and a single line configuration, with one foot spacing between both lines and plants. Brinjal plants are spaced two feet apart. Ongoing field cleansing processes sometimes are interrupted by rain. A reduced seed quantity is needed for monsoon sowing, leading to good yield and 8-10 buds per sugarcane plant. This planting strategy allows for efficient irrigation from a single water source for three different crops.
  
  To make use of the available space, potatoes will be planted on the ridges constructed on both sides of the sugarcane. The configuration allows for a good yield without the need for soil mounding at the base of the sugarcane, as the seed can be engaged in two shapes: round dough and long dough. Following plowing, soil adjacent to the sugarcane rows is designated for potato planting, while the vacant line between the sugarcane rows is reserved for mustard black rye.
  
  The choice to maintain cleanliness in the field offers benefits such as grass growth, which can strengthen the farm and assist with manure utilization.

In the described method, potatoes and peas are intercropped with sugarcane. The peas, grown alongside sugarcane, benefit from the shade and support of the taller plants. This relationship prevents grass growth and creates a symbiotic environment where peas thrive without competing with sugarcane.
  
  Potatoes are planted on either side of the sugarcane, with a specific focus on using fertilizers that contain potash, urea, and sulfur to enrich the soil. Additionally, other treatments such as Maiko king and zyme may be applied to the crops. Regular crop maintenance includes cutting the leaves to increase the tiller count in sugarcane plants.
  
  The potatoes are irrigated with moisture control to prevent overwatering, relying on soil dampness rather than direct watering. Sugarcane cultivation aims for high tiller production, with a goal of having ten to eleven canes per plant. These practices involve using minimal seed quantities while expecting substantial crop yields.
  
  The field management embraces a dry irrigation system, leading to three crops - brinjal (eggplant), potato, and sugarcane - sharing one watering scheme. This integrated approach to managing water underscores the efficiency of resources used.

 Sustainable development aims to meet current needs without compromising future generations. Sustainable agriculture seeks to satisfy present food requirements while protecting future resource availability by utilizing renewable resources, maintaining soil health, and conserving wildlife and forests.
 
 Sustainable agriculture incorporates more than just organic farming; it involves enhancing organic fertilizers, biological procedures, pest control, and integrated nutrient management. It involves efficient irrigation, crop rotation, water-efficient crops, soil conservation, and sustainable practices in farming and fishing to prevent soil erosion, overgrazing, overfishing, and biodiversity loss.
 
 Organic farming avoids synthetic inputs like fertilizers, pesticides, hormones, and feed additives. It emphasizes crop rotation, waste management, and integrated nutrient and pest management.
 
 Vermi-composting produces compost that adds micro-nutrients to the soil and boosts its water retention capacity. Bio-fertilizers, which include varieties such as Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, and Bacillus, are useful in crops like paddy, pulses, vegetables, and coconuts.

ZBNF is recognized as a form of organic farming with distinct characteristics, including the elimination of purchased inputs, as everything needed is sourced from the farm itself. This farming approach is inspired by traditional Indian agricultural practices, which are inherently chemical-free, as still evident in certain regions.
 
 A notable advocate for ZBNF offered an alternative to the Green Revolution, challenging issues like chemical dependency, environmental degradation, and financial burdens on farmers. ZBNF rests on four pillars including seed treatment using natural substances, soil treatment and nurturing of organisms without chemicals, surface cover to maintain moisture and control weeds, and soil aeration to enhance microbial activity. Demonstrating a sustainable model, ZBNF relies entirely on farm-sourced inputs, distinguishing it from other organic practices that often depend on market-purchased inputs, seeds, and certifications.
 
 State-sponsored initiatives supporting ZBNF and sustainable farming methods have been launched, with allocated land for the practice and schemes to promote efficient farming. Additionally, educational platforms are offering test series for exams, featuring discounts and features like performance tracking and personalized reports. These platforms provide resources in various languages and support through mentorship programs.","Advocating for sustainable farming practices, the text focuses on the cost-effective and self-reliant approach of Zero Budget Natural Farming which emphasizes organic methods and traditional Indian agricultural knowledge.","Indian Agriculture, Zero Budget Natural Farming, Sustainable Agriculture, Organic Farming, chemical-free agriculture, Subhash Palekar, Green Revolution, Seed Amrit, soil humus, market dependency"

INM involves the balanced use of organic and inorganic fertilizers to enhance soil fertility and promote healthy crop growth. Biofertilizers, a component of INM, are substances introduced to soil that contain microorganisms, which help enrich the soil with essential nutrients.
 
 The practice of INM suggests using a combination of organic manures, biofertilizers, and proper cropping choices to maintain soil health. Organic manures include cattle dung, compost, and vermicompost. Concentrated Organic Manure, such as oil cake derived from plant residue, is categorized into Edible Oil Cake, fed to animals, and Non-Edible Oil Cake, used in crop cultivation.
 
 The long-term use of chemical fertilizers alone can lead to reduced soil fertility. INM addresses this by incorporating a variety of nutrient sources. These additions not only contribute nutrients but can also affect soil structure and fertility.
 
 Cropping practices that support INM include crop rotation and integrated farming approaches such as permaculture, which all aim to improve soil nutrient levels. Implementing such strategies ensures a more sustainable approach to agriculture.
 
 Educational services offering guidance on INM include lectures and study material distributions such as PDFs via communication channels. Additionally, educational programs offer tests for general studies and Civil Services Aptitude Test (CSAT) preparation, with discounts and loan facilities for subscriptions to their services.

It seeks to be cost-effective, environmentally sound, and socially acceptable. Worldwide, 40% of crops are lost to pests, a situation exacerbated by climate change. Increasing pest damage has been observed in countries like India due to pests from regions such as Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Oman.
 
 Over-reliance on pesticides can lead to health issues for consumers, including pregnant women and children, and cause economic burden for farmers. Pesticides contribute to biodiversity loss, soil fertility decline, and pollution of air and water.
 
 The social impact of pesticide use is significant and is linked to farmer suicides, with pesticide self-poisoning being a major factor. IPM addresses these issues with a three-pillared approach: prevention, monitoring, and intervention. Prevention involves cultural practices such as crop rotation and careful irrigation to minimize pest outbreaks, along with selecting pest-resistant crop varieties.
 
 Monitoring requires regular field inspections to identify pests early. Intervention strategies include a combination of physical, chemical, biological, and cultural techniques. Physical methods include mechanical control, mulching, and barriers to prevent pest access to crops. Chemical methods focus on targeted pesticide use to minimize collateral damage and should be used selectively and minimally. Biological control leverages natural predators, parasites, pathogens, and competitors of pests.
 
 The goal of IPM is to preserve air, soil, and water quality and maintain biodiversity while maximizing agricultural yield. This includes avoiding extensive pesticide spraying and utilizing natural pest enemies. By identifying and nurturing these relationships, agricultural systems can control pests without relying on harmful chemicals.","Integrated Pest Management emphasizes sustainable agricultural practices that prevent pest outbreaks, promote monitoring and targeted interventions, and aim to minimize chemical pesticide use for environmental and health safety.","sustainable agriculture, Integrated Pest Management, Integrated Nutrient Management, crop production, pests, climate change, biodiversity, soil fertility, farmers suicide, cost-effective environmental strategy"

Campaigns have been initiated to enhance insurance policy awareness and transparency. Some regions have implemented unique initiatives to display insurance claim details at the community level, and offices for insurance companies have been provided to address farmer grievances efficiently.

Public-Private Partnerships have led to the implementation of projects that record real-time weather parameters via automated weather stations. Smart sampling technology has replaced traditional plot chaining methods for insurance units in agriculture. Modern technology like apps for plot surveys linked with insurance schemes and digital land records is being adopted to benefit farmers and promote more efficient agricultural practices.","Advancements in technology and strategic partnerships have modernized agricultural insurance, providing farmers with expedited, transparent access to coverage and claims processing.","insurance program, farmers, security coverage, sowing, post-harvest, national portal, crop failure, app, crop cutting experiments, Public-Private Partnerships, automated weather stations, smart sampling technology, digital land records"

However, moong crops are fragile and subject to various risks. It's important to select high-quality seeds, determine the appropriate pesticide, and consider the potential impact of natural disasters on the crop yield.

Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), an insurance scheme, was introduced in 2016 to support farmers against crop losses due to unexpected and adverse weather conditions. This insurance covers a range of risks, including drought, flooding, waterlogging, widespread pest infestations, fire from natural causes, lightning, storms, hailstorms, and cyclones.

Farmers can insure their crops under this scheme, and in the event of a disaster, they should report their losses to the insurance company using a toll-free number, a crop insurance app, or through bank or agricultural department officials, all within a 72-hour timeframe following the incident. This initiative is a collaboration involving authorities and insurance firms and aims to mitigate financial losses resulting from agricultural risks.",Safeguarding farmers' livelihoods with crop insurance ensures protection against agricultural uncertainties and natural calamities.,"Moong, crop, yield, high-quality seeds, pesticide, natural disasters, crop insurance, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, PMFBY, agricultural risks"

The crop insurance program, initiated in 2016, protects crops from sowing to post-harvest, and over 10 crore farmer applications have been paid more than 1,15,000 crore in claims over six years. A National Crop Insurance Portal facilitates farmer registration and policy status checks, making the process more accessible. The program also features an increased reporting time window for crop failure, now reduced to fifty-two hours and reportable through a mobile app. The CCE Agri-Mobile App, used for recording crop cutting experiments which are essential for insurance claims, makes the system paperless and provides real-time data with timestamps and geo-tags. This has enabled faster settlement of claims due to prompt data uploads.

Awareness initiatives have been undertaken to educate farmers on insurance benefits. One such campaign involved door-to-door policy distribution. Another initiative displayed claim details of farmers at the village level to enhance transparency. Offices for insurance companies have been provided space within certain state governments, facilitating timely grievance redressal.

Technological advancements have been adopted for more efficient implementation, including an app that integrates crop surveys with digital land records. These innovations aid in precise crop verification and claim entitlement. Additionally, weather data is collected through public-private collaboration using automatic weather stations to inform insurance-related decisions. Smart sampling technology has also been implemented for more accurate estimation of crop yield.
