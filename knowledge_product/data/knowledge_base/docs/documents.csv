 management, which is considered as Fertilizer Best Management Practice, needs to be promoted
 to improve soil health and crop productivity. Inadequate and unreliable soil-testing facilities
 poor awareness of farmers about balanced plant nutrition and lack of appropriate policy are
 the major constraints in adoption of Fertilizer Best Management Practices. It is realized that
 the soil-testing service has not made the desired impact and farmers have not yet been able to
 adopt it in large numbers. On the other hand, on-station and on-farm experiments conducted
 under diverse agro-ecologies across the country established the significance of soil-test based
 balanced fertilizer use in improving crop yields and nutrient use efficiency. Compared with
 farmers fertilizer practice, 20-25% yield gain could be easily obtained with the adoption of
 soil-test based recommendations, although much greater advantages are also reported
 depending on soil conditions and crops/cropping systems. The Pusa STFR Meter would
 increase farmers access to soil testing, and thus help them to achieve higher yields owing to
 soil test based fertilizer application.",Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2705,NA

Brick walls are constructed above the floor of the pits leaving 5-6 gaps in the pit wall of 10 cm dia to facilitate aeration. These holes are blocked with nylon screen (100 mesh) to prevent escape of earthworms from the pits. 3-4 cm thic layer of partially decomposed dung (about 2-month-old) is spread on the bottom of the pits. A layer of litter/residue and dung in the ratio of 1:1 (w/w) is then added.

 Irrigation Efficiency"," > Salient features
 The chemical clogging is a major problem for drip irrigation system users. In India, most of water used for irrigation contains calcium and magnesium. Calcium carbonate is common in arid region. Hydrogen sulphite with calcium carbonate greater than 40 mg/litre promotes formation of precipitation in drippers which adversely affect the water application efficiency and hence crop yield. Specific ion concentration, water pH and temperature play an important role in chemical clogging. Acidification is only alternative to remove such clogging. The use of hydrochloric acid- HCl (36%), sulphuric acid (98%) and nitric acid (60%) as per schedule through drip irrigation system can solve the salt clogging problem. Algae and fungi are the major contributors of biological clogging restricting the path of emitters. Chlorination is a main remedy to control the biological clogging. Generally calcium hypochlorite or sodium hypochlorite or chlorine gas can be used for chlorination treatment. Hence the acidification and chlorination is very much important for uniform application of water to each and every plant and at every corner of the field. The information regarding acidification as per water quality for drip irrigation is not available .Farmers were not well aware about the acid injection rate as per existing quality of water source. Recommendation: Following equation is recommended for calculation of acid injection rate and constant for acid treatment through drip irrigation system. The equation applicable for pH of water 7.3 to 8.5 I.R. = Y x Qs where I.R., Acid injection rate through drip irrigation system (lph); Y, Acid Injection Constant (using HCL 36 %);

 with an average of 500 g/ tree. The rate of pure gum Arabic in the market is ₹ 500-700/kg. In gum belt of arid region of western Rajasthan, on an average farmers have 20-25 trees/ ha on agricultural fields in different parts. Treating half of the trees in alternate years, a farmer can earn ₹ 11,500-13,000/ha. By using this technology, the farmers of target villages in Barmer, Jodhpur and Nagaur district have earned a revenue of about ₹ 194 lakhs between 2009-10 to 2011-12.",Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2810,NA

 Potential of plant essential oils as repellents against rodent pests and other plant products as reproductive inhibitors of predominant rodent species is being studied for use in integration with chemical control. This will lead to reduced usage of rodenticides as well as a method effective in long term and ecofriendly in nature.
 > Performance results
 Castor oil (5%) has shown both repellent and antifeeding effects against Rattus , rattus and Tatera indica with sustainability up to 2-3 weeks, whereas, triptolide (0.2% in bait) obtained from plant Tripterygium wilfordii, has shown effectiveness in reducing resiliency in population of R. rattus in poultry farms upto 60 days of treatment.
 > Cost of technology
 Field-scale testing and determination of cost and output per unit area yet to be conducted.

> Seedling / nursery stage- Vegetable nursery should be raised in poly house or make proper arrangement of low height Polly tunnels in open area or cover with plastic sheet or thatching should be done
Vegetative stage- In vegetables-Remove damages parts immediately and apply insecticide followed by fungicide as prophylactic measures. Follow fertilization through foliar as well as broadcasting
Reproductive stage- n vegetables- Remove damaged parts immediately and apply insecticide followed by fungicide as prophylactic measures. Follow fertilization through foliar as well as broadcasting for proper fruiting At harvest- Safely sell in the market after grading for immediate returns
Heat Wave
> Wheat Chickpea/pea
Seedling / nursery stage- For protection from heat and cold wave there is intervention to sow the rabi crops in between 2nd week of October to 2nd week of November to protect theirs vegetative phase from ground/radiation frost results from cold wave/wind chill injury and reproductive phase from terminal heat stress on Mustard, Chickpea, Wheat, Lentil, Linseed and pea crops. Life saving irrigation
Vegetative stage- Timely sown crop never face heat stress while very late sown( January) crop face heat stress hence only one option is to provide life saving irrigation and water spray during evening time frequently at 2-3 days intervals. Take care of termite attack by spraying Chlorpyriphos @ @ 1 ml/lt. water and drenching @ 3-5 ml/lt water In Chickpea because of high soil and ambient temperature (> 35 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂºC) favours the dry root rot disease starts during flowering/reproductive stage (spraying Captan or thiram or carbendazim or ridomil MZ or Saaf @ 1,5-2 g/lt water) Reproductive stage- To minimize the terminal heat stress druing the month of March and April the only and only way is to provide frequent protective irrigation irrespective of theirs stages (Life saving irrigation). Take care of termite attack by spraying Chlorpyriphos @ @ 1 ml/lt and drenching @ 3-5 ml/lt water. In Chickpea because of high soil and ambient temperature (> 35 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂºC) favours the dry root rot disease starts during flowering/reproductive stage (spraying Captan or thiram or carbendazim or ridomil MZ or Saaf @ 1,5-2 g/lt water)
At harvest- Frequent irrigation should be provided to meet the evaporative losses.

Vegetative stage- Due to heat stress wilting and mortality is more hence frequent irrigation and cover the nursery with mulch(Straw/leaves
Reproductive stage- Drying of flower- Spray PCOA. Follow mulching after irrigation At harvest- Immediate harvest after irrigation and shift it to safer place
Cold wave
Wheat
> Seedling / nursery stage- Cold environment during tillering or branching stage favours more number of tillers in wheat and more branching in mustard, chickpea, lentil and linseed crops which prospects for high yield but it is detrimental for potato, tomato, brinjal, pea, creeper vegetables and fruits. Irrigation. Balanced fertilizer application.
Foliar spray of nutrients Vegetative stage- Light irrigation. Mulching with crop residue \ weeds. Fertilizer application Reproductive stage- Irrigation, fertilizer application At harvest- N/A
Pigeonpea/Mustard/Linseed/Chickpea/pea
> Seedling / nursery stage- In Mustard because of cool weather aphid insects attack is more prominent (spraying Rogor (Dimethoate) @ 2 ml or Monocrotophos 36 EC @ 1 ml /lt water during evening time is advised).
In linseed Alterneria blight ( For blight spray Double dose (Iprodione 25 % WP + Carbendazim 25 % WP) @ 2 g per lt. water) and powdery mildew (prophylactic spraying of Sulfex @ 3 g or Kairathen 1 ml per lt water twice at weekly interval during evening time) disease are more common. For powdery mildew in pea (spraying Calixin (Tridemorf 80 % EC @ 5 ml per 10 lt water twice are highly recommended).
In Chickpea-Cold and wet environment (High humidity) during seedling stage cause collar rot, black root rot, wet rot, Pythium root and seed rot in Chickpea, while in potato, pea and tomato favours late blight (spraying of Krilaksil or Ridomil MZ chemical@ 1.5 g per liter water), powdery mildew (spraying newly emerged fungicide Double dose (Iprodione 25 % WP + Carbendazim 25 % WP ) 2 g per lt water twice at weekly interval) and bacterial wilt, leaf spot and canker (spraying carbendazim @ 2g/lt water and streptocycline @ 1g/10 lt. water at 10 DAP, 25 DAP and 40 DAP) diseases in respective vegetable crops. Anthracnose in cucurbitaceous species. Vegetative stage- Provide light irrigation. Follow mulching with crop residue \ weeds\straw\leaves. In Mustard because of cool weather aphid insects attack is more prominent (spraying Rogor (Dimethoate) @ 2 ml or or Monocrotophos 36 EC @ 1 ml /lt water during evening time is advised)
Reproductive stage- Pigeonpea- During flowering and pod formation stage attack of Pod borer/sucking bug, mites, blister beetle insects as well as sterility disease may occur more (spraying Profenophos 50 EC, methomyl 40 SP or monocrotophos 36 SL kill the larvae but as the webs protect them from contact insecticides hence along with contact insecticides, mixing of fumigant insecticide such as DDVP @ 0.5 ml/lt. water is required to make the larvae come out from the web. For Mites and Aphids, Dimethoate 30 EC @ 2ml/lt. water and acaricides such as Dicofol 18.5 EC @ 2.5 ml/lt. water , for Blister beetle synthetic pyrethroids such as Cypermethrin 10 EC @ 1.0 ml/lt. or Lamda cyhalothrin 5 EC @ 1.0 ml/lt. water; for sterility mosaic Dicofol 18.5 EC 2.5 ml or Oxydemeton methyl 25 EC or Dimethoate 30 EC 2.0 ml/lt. water on alternate row twice at an interval of 10 days are recommended).

 Hail storm
 > Seedling / nursery stage- Vegetable nursery should be raised in poly house or make proper arrangement of low height Polly tunnels in open area or cover with plastic sheet or thatching should be done
 > Vegetative stage- In vegetables-Remove damages parts immediately and apply insecticide followed by fungicide as prophylactic measures. Follow fertilization through foliar as well as broadcasting
 > Reproductive stage- n vegetables- Remove damaged parts immediately and apply insecticide followed by fungicide as prophylactic measures. Follow fertilization through foliar as well as broadcasting for proper fruiting At harvest- Safely sell in the market after grading for immediate returns
 Heat Wave
 > Wheat Chickpea/pea
 > Seedling / nursery stage- For protection from heat and cold wave there is intervention to sow the rabi crops in between 2nd week of October to 2nd week of November to protect theirs vegetative phase from ground/radiation frost results from cold wave/wind chill injury and reproductive phase from terminal heat stress on Mustard, Chickpea, Wheat, Lentil, Linseed and pea crops. Life saving irrigation
 > Vegetative stage- Timely sown crop never face heat stress while very late sown( January) crop face heat stress hence only one option is to provide life saving irrigation and water spray during evening time frequently at 2-3 days intervals. Take care of termite attack by spraying Chlorpyriphos @ @ 1 ml/lt and drenching @ 3-5 ml/lt water
 In Chickpea because of high soil and ambient temperature (> 35 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂºC) favours the dry root rot disease starts during flowering/reproductive stage (spraying Captan or thiram or carbendazim or ridomil MZ or Saaf @ 1,5-2 g/lt water) Reproductive stage- To minimize the terminal heat stress druing the month of March and April the only and only way is to provide frequent protective irrigation irrespective of theirs stages (Life saving irrigation). Take care of termite attack by spraying Chlorpyriphos @ @ 1 ml/lt and drenching @ 3-5 ml/lt water. In Chickpea because of high soil and ambient temperature (> 35 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂºC) favours the dry root rot disease starts during flowering/reproductive stage (spraying Captan or thiram or carbendazim or ridomil MZ or Saaf @ 1,5-2 g/lt water)
 > At harvest- Frequent irrigation should be provided to meet the evaporative losses.
 > Tomato/Brinjal/ lady's finger/Cucurbits
 > Seedling / nursery stage- Due to heat stress wilting and mortality is more hence frequent irrigation and cover the nursery with mulch(Straw/leaves
 > Vegetative stage- Due to heat stress wilting and mortality is more hence frequent irrigation and cover the nursery with mulch(Straw/leaves
 > Reproductive stage- Drying of flower- Spray PCOA. Follow mulching after irrigation At harvest- Immediate harvest after irrigation and shift it to safer place
 Cold wave
 Wheat
 Seedling / nursery stage- Cold environment during tillering or branching stage favours more number of tillers in wheat and more branching in mustard, chickpea, lentil and linseed crops which prospects for high yield but it is detrimental for potato, tomato, brinjal, pea, creeper vegetables and fruits. Irrigation. Balanced fertilizer application. Foliar spray of nutrients
 Vegetative stage- Light irrigation. Mulching with crop residue \ weeds. Fertilizer application Reproductive stage- Irrigation, fertilizer application
 At harvest- N/A Pigeonpea/Mustard/Linseed/Chickpea/pea
 Seedling / nursery stage- In Mustard because of cool weather aphid insects attack is more prominent (spraying Rogor (Dimethoate) @ 2 ml or or Monocrotophos 36 EC @ 1 ml /lt water during evening time is advised). In linseed Alterneria blight ( For blight spray Double dose (Iprodione 25 % WP + Carbendazim 25 % WP) @ 2 g per lt. water) and powdery mildew (prophylactic spraying of Sulfex @ 3 g or Karathene 1 ml per lt water twice at weekly interval during evening time) disease are more common. For powdery mildew in pea (spraying Calixin (Tridemorf 80 % EC @ 5 ml per 10 lt water twice are highly recommended).
 In Chickpea-Cold and wet environment (High humidity) during seedling stage cause collar rot, black root rot, wet rot, Pythium root and seed rot in Chickpea, while in potato, pea and tomato favours late blight (spraying of Krilaksil or Ridomil MZ chemical@ 1.5 g per liter water), powdery mildew (spraying newly emerged fungicide Double dose (Iprodione 25 % WP + Carbendazim 25 % WP ) 2 g per lt water twice at weekly interval) and bacterial wilt, leaf spot and canker (spraying carbendazim @ 2g/lt water and streptocycline @ 1g/10 lt. water at 10 DAP, 25 DAP and 40 DAP) diseases in respective vegetable crops. Anthracnose in cucurbitaceous species. Vegetative stage- Provide light irrigation. Follow mulching with crop residue \ weeds\straw\leaves. In Mustard because of cool weather aphid insects attack is more prominent (spraying Rogor (Dimethoate) @ 2 ml or or Monocrotophos 36 EC @ 1 ml /lt water during evening time is advised)
 Reproductive stage- Pigeonpea- During flowering and pod formation stage attack of Pod borer/sucking bug, mites, blister beetle insects as well as sterility disease may occur more (spraying Profenophos 50 EC, methomyl 40 SP or monocrotophos 36 SL kill the larvae but as the webs protect them from contact insecticides hence along with contact insecticides, mixing of fumigant insecticide such as DDVP @ 0.5 ml/l is required to make the larvae come out from the web. For Mites and Aphids, Dimethoate 30 EC @ 2ml/l and acaricides such as Dicofol 18.5 EC @ 2.5 ml/l water , for Blister beetle synthetic pyrethroids such as Cypermethrin 10 EC @ 1.0 ml/l or Lamda cyhalothrin 5 EC @ 1.0 ml/l water; for sterility mosaic Dicofol 18.5 EC 2.5 ml or Oxydemeton methyl 25 EC or Dimethoate 30 EC 2.0 ml or ml/l water on alternate row twice at an interval of 10 days are recommended).

 Hail storm
 > Seedling / nursery stage- Vegetable nursery should be raised in poly house or make proper arrangement of low height Polly tunnels in open area or cover with plastic sheet or thatching should be done
 > Vegetative stage- In vegetables-Remove damages parts immediately and apply insecticide followed by fungicide as prophylactic measures. Follow fertilization through foliar as well as broadcasting
 > Reproductive stage- n vegetables- Remove damaged parts immediately and apply insecticide followed by fungicide as prophylactic measures. Follow fertilization through foliar as well as broadcasting for proper fruiting At harvest- Safely sell in the market after grading for immediate returns
 Heat Wave
 > Wheat Chickpea/pea
 > Seedling / nursery stage- For protection from heat and cold wave there is intervention to sow the rabi crops in between 2nd week of October to 2nd week of November to protect theirs vegetative phase from ground/radiation frost results from cold wave/wind chill injury and reproductive phase from terminal heat stress on Mustard, Chickpea, Wheat, Lentil, Linseed and pea crops. Life saving irrigation
 > Vegetative stage- Timely sown crop never face heat stress while very late sown( January) crop face heat stress hence only one option is to provide life saving irrigation and water spray during evening time frequently at 2-3 days intervals. Take care of termite attack by spraying Chlorpyriphos @ @ 1 ml/lt and drenching @ 3-5 ml/lt water In Chickpea because of high soil and ambient temperature (> 35 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C) favours the dry root rot disease starts during flowering/reproductive stage (spraying Captan or thiram or carbendazim or ridomil MZ or Saaf @ 1,5-2 g/lt water) Reproductive stage- To minimize the terminal heat stress druing the month of March and April the only and only way is to provide frequent protective irrigation irrespective of theirs stages (Life saving irrigation). Take care of termite attack by spraying Chlorpyriphos @ @ 1 ml/lt and drenching @ 3-5 ml/lt water. In Chickpea because of high soil and ambient temperature (> 35 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂºC) favours the dry root rot disease starts during flowering/reproductive stage (spraying captan or thiram or carbendazim or ridomil MZ or Saaf @ 1,5-2 g/lt water)
 > At harvest- Frequent irrigation should be provided to meet the evaporative losses.
 > Tomato/Brinjal/ lady's finger/Cucurbits

 > Reproductive stage- Drying of flower- Spray PCOA. Follow mulching after irrigation At harvest- Immediate harvest after irrigation and shift it to safer place
 Cold wave
 > Wheat
 > Seedling / nursery stage- Cold environment during tillering or branching stage favours more number of tillers in wheat and more branching in mustard, chickpea, lentil and linseed crops which prospects for high yield but it is detrimental for potato, tomato, brinjal, pea, creeper vegetables and fruits. Irrigation. Balanced fertilizer application.

 Seedling / nursery stage- In Mustard because of cool weather aphid insects attack is more prominent (spraying Rogor (Dimethoate) @ 2 ml. water or Monocrotophos 36 EC @ 1 ml /lt water during evening time is advised).
 In Chickpea-Cold and wet environment (High humidity) during seedling stage cause collar rot, black root rot, wet rot, Pythium root and seed rot in Chickpea, while in potato, pea and tomato favours late blight (spraying of Krilaksil or Ridomil MZ chemical@ 1.5 g per liter water), powdery mildew (spraying newly emerged fungicide Double dose (Iprodione 25 % WP + Carbendazim 25 % WP ) 2 g per lt water twice at weekly interval) and bacterial wilt, leaf spot and canker (spraying carbendazim @ 2g/lt water and streptocycline @ 1g/10 lt. water at 10 DAP, 25 DAP and 40 DAP) diseases in respective vegetable crops. Anthracnose in cucurbitaceous species. Vegetative stage- Provide light irrigation. Follow mulching with crop residue \ weeds\straw\leaves. In Mustard because of cool weather aphid insects attack is more prominent (spraying Rogor (Dimethoate) @ 2 ml or or Monocrotophos 36 EC @ 1 ml /lt water during evening time is advised)
 Reproductive stage- Pigeonpea- During flowering and pod formation stage attack of Pod borer/sucking bug, mites, blister beetle insects as well as sterility disease may occur more (spraying Profenophos 50 EC, methomyl 40 SP or monocrotophos 36 SL kill the larvae but as the webs protect them from contact insecticides hence along with contact insecticides, mixing of fumigant insecticide such as DDVP @ 0.5 ml/l is required to make the larvae come out from the web. For Mites and Aphids, Dimethoate 30 EC @ 2ml/l and acaricides such as Dicofol 18.5 EC @ 2.5 ml/l water , for Blister beetle synthetic pyrethroids such as Cypermethrin 10 EC @ 1.0 ml/l or Lamda cyhalothrin 5 EC @ 1.0 ml/l water; for sterility mosaic Dicofol 18.5 EC 2.5 ml or Oxydemeton methyl 25 EC or Dimethoate 30 EC 2.0 ml or ml/l water on alternate row twice at an interval of 10 days are recommended).

 Heat Wave
 > Wheat Chickpea/pea
 > Seedling / nursery stage- For protection from heat and cold wave there is intervention to sow the rabi crops in between 2nd week of October to 2nd week of November to protect theirs vegetative phase from ground/radiation frost results from cold wave/wind chill injury and reproductive phase from terminal heat stress on Mustard, Chickpea, Wheat, Lentil, Linseed and pea crops. Life saving irrigation
 > Vegetative stage- Timely sown crop never face heat stress while very late sown( January) crop face heat stress hence only one option is to provide life saving irrigation and water spray during evening time frequently at 2-3 days intervals. Take care of termite attack by spraying Chlorpyriphos @ @ 1 ml/lt and drenching @ 3-5 ml/lt water In Chickpea because of high soil and ambient temperature (> 35¢) favours the dry root rot disease starts during flowering/reproductive stage (spraying Captan or thiram or carbendazim or ridomil MZ or Saaf @ 1,5-2 g/lt water) Reproductive stage- To minimize the terminal heat stress during the month of March and April the only and only way is to provide frequent protective irrigation irrespective of theirs stages (Life saving irrigation). Take care of termite attack by spraying Chlorpyriphos @ @ 1 ml/lt and drenching @ 3-5 ml/lt water. In Chickpea because of high soil and ambient temperature (> 35 ) favours the dry root rot disease starts during flowering/reproductive stage (spraying Captan or thiram or carbendazim or ridomil MZ or Saaf @ 1,5-2 g/lt water)
 > At harvest- Frequent irrigation should be provided to meet the evaporative losses.

 B. Extreme Weather Events Suggested Contingency measures
 Hail storm
 Seedling / nursery stage- Vegetable nursery should be raised in poly house or make proper arrangement of low height Polly tunnels in open area or cover with plastic sheet or thatching should be done
 Vegetative stage- In vegetables-Remove damages parts immediately and apply insecticide followed by fungicide as prophylactic measures. Follow fertilization through foliar as well as broadcasting
 Reproductive stage- n vegetables- Remove damaged parts immediately and apply insecticide followed by fungicide as prophylactic measures. Follow fertilization through foliar as well as broadcasting for proper fruiting At harvest- Safely sell in the market after grading for immediate returns
 Heat Wave
 Wheat Chickpea/pea
 Seedling / nursery stage- For protection from heat and cold wave there is intervention to sow the rabi crops in between 2nd week of October to 2nd week of November to protect theirs vegetative phase from ground/radiation frost results from cold wave/wind chill injury and reproductive phase from terminal heat stress on Mustard, Chickpea, Wheat, Lentil, Linseed and pea crops. Life saving irrigation
 Vegetative stage- Timely sown crop never face heat stress while very late sown( January) crop face heat stress hence only one option is to provide life saving irrigation and water spray during evening time frequently at 2-3 days intervals. Take care of termite attack by spraying Chlorpyriphos @ @ 1 ml/lt and drenching @ 3-5 ml/lt water In Chickpea because of high soil and ambient temperature (> 35 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂºC) favours the dry root rot disease starts during flowering/reproductive stage (spraying Captan or thiram or carbendazim or ridomil MZ or Saaf @ 1,5-2 g/lt water) Reproductive stage- To minimize the terminal heat stress druing the month of March and April the only and only way is to provide frequent protective irrigation irrespective of theirs stages (Life saving irrigation). Take care of termite attack by spraying Chlorpyriphos @ @ 1 ml/lt and drenching @ 3-5 ml/lt water. In Chickpea because of high soil and ambient temperature (> 35 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂºC) favours the dry root rot disease starts during flowering/reproductive stage (spraying Captan or thiram or carbendazim or ridomil MZ or Saaf @ 1,5-2 g/lt water)
 At harvest- Frequent irrigation should be provided to meet the evaporative losses.
 Tomato/Brinjal/ lady's finger/Cucurbits

 Reproductive stage- Drying of flower- Spray PCOA. Follow mulching after irrigation At harvest- Immediate harvest after irrigation and shift it to safer place
 Cold wave
 Wheat
 Seedling / nursery stage- Cold environment during tillering or branching stage favours more number of tillers in wheat and more branching in mustard, chickpea, lentil and linseed crops which prospects for high yield but it is detrimental for potato, tomato, brinjal, pea, creeper vegetables and fruits. Irrigation. Balanced fertilizer application.
 Foliar spray of nutrients Vegetative stage- Light irrigation. Mulching with crop residue \ weeds. Fertilizer application Reproductive stage- Irrigation, fertilizer application At harvest- N/A
 Pigeonpea/Mustard/Linseed/Chickpea/pea
 Seedling / nursery stage- In Mustard because of cool weather aphid insects attack is more prominent (spraying Rogor (Dimethoate) @ 2 ml or or Monocrotophos 36 EC @ 1 ml /lt. water during evening time is advised).
 In linseed Alterneria blight ( For blight spray Double dose (Iprodione 25 % WP + Carbendazim 25 % WP) @ 2 g per lt. water) and powdery mildew (prophylactic spraying of Sulfex @ 3 g or Karathene 1 ml per lt. water twice at weekly interval during evening time) disease are more common. For powdery mildew in pea (spraying Calixin (Tridemorf 80 % EC @ 5 ml per 10 lt. water twice are highly recommended).
 In Chickpea-Cold and wet environment (High humidity) during seedling stage cause collar rot, black root rot, wet rot, Pythium root and seed rot in Chickpea, while in potato, pea and tomato favours late blight (spraying of Krilaksil or Ridomil MZ chemical@ 1.5 g per lt. water), powdery mildew (spraying newly emerged fungicide Double dose (Iprodione 25 % WP + Carbendazim 25 % WP ) 2 g per lt water twice at weekly interval) and bacterial wilt, leaf spot and canker (spraying carbendazim @ 2g/lt. water and streptocycline @ 1g/10 lt. water at 10 DAP, 25 DAP and 40 DAP) diseases in respective vegetable crops. Anthracnose in cucurbitaceous species. Vegetative stage- Provide light irrigation. Follow mulching with crop residue \ weeds\straw\leaves. In Mustard because of cool weather aphid insects attack is more prominent (spraying Rogor (Dimethoate) @ 2 ml/lt. water or or Monocrotophos 36 EC @ 1 ml /lt water during evening time is advised)
 Reproductive stage- Pigeonpea- During flowering and pod formation stage attack of Pod borer/sucking bug, mites, blister beetle insects as well as sterility disease may occur more (spraying Profenophos 50 EC, methomyl 40 SP or monocrotophos 36 SL kill the larvae but as the webs protect them from contact insecticides hence along with contact insecticides, mixing of fumigant insecticide such as DDVP @ 0.5 ml/lt. water is required to make the larvae come out from the web. For Mites and Aphids, Dimethoate 30 EC @ 2ml/l and acaricides such as Dicofol 18.5 EC @ 2.5 ml/l water , for Blister beetle synthetic pyrethroids such as Cypermethrin 10 EC @ 1.0 ml/l or Lamda cyhalothrin 5 EC @ 1.0 ml/lt. water; for sterility mosaic Dicofol 18.5 EC 2.5 ml or Oxydemeton methyl 25 EC or Dimethoate 30 EC 2.0 ml or ml/lt. water on alternate row twice at an interval of 10 days are recommended).

Life saving irrigation
 > Vegetative stage- Timely sown crop never face heat stress while very late sown( January) crop face heat stress hence only one option is to provide life saving irrigation and water spray during evening time frequently at 2-3 days intervals. Take care of termite attack by spraying Chlorpyriphos @ @ 1 ml/lt and drenching @ 3-5 ml/lt water
 In Chickpea because of high soil and ambient temperature (> 35 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂºC) favours the dry root rot disease starts during flowering/reproductive stage (spraying Captan or thiram or carbendazim or ridomil MZ or Saaf @ 1,5-2 g/lt water)

 > Seedling / nursery stage- In Mustard because of cool weather aphid insects attack is more prominent (spraying Rogor (Dimethoate) @ 2 ml or or Monocrotophos 36 EC @ 1 ml /lt water during evening time is advised).
 In linseed Alterneria blight ( For blight spray Double dose (Iprodione 25 % WP + Carbendazim 25 % WP) @ 2 g per lt. water) and powdery mildew (prophylactic spraying of Sulfex @ 3 g or Kairathen 1 ml per lt water twice at weekly interval during evening time) disease are more common. For powdery mildew in pea (spraying Calixin (Tridemorf 80 % EC @ 5 ml per 10 lt water twice are highly recommended).
 In Chickpea-Cold and wet environment (High humidity) during seedling stage cause collar rot, black root rot, wet rot, Pythium root and seed rot in Chickpea, while in potato, pea and tomato favours late blight (spraying of Krilaksil or Ridomil MZ chemical@ 1.5 g per liter water), powdery mildew (spraying newly emerged fungicide Double dose (Iprodione 25 % WP + Carbendazim 25 % WP ) 2 g per lt water twice at weekly interval) and bacterial wilt, leaf spot and canker (spraying carbendazim @ 2g/lt water and streptocycline @ 1g/10 lt. water at 10 DAP, 25 DAP and 40 DAP) diseases in respective vegetable crops.

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) ranks climate change among the main direct drivers affecting ecosystems. Consequences of climate change on the species component of biodiversity include:
 >  Changes in distribution
 > Increased extinction rates
 > Changes in reproduction timings
 > Changes in length of growing seasons for plants
 Some already-threatened species are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and climate variability. Changes in rainfall distribution, temperature, flooding, and sea level rise will be the most obvious effects on ecosystem boundaries and the functions within them. As a result of these changes in functions and shifts in boundaries, some ecosystems will expand into new areas, while others will become smaller. Habitats will change as rainfall and temperatures change, and some species will not be able to adapt, leading to a sharp increase in extinction rates. Global warming is also causing shifts in the reproductive cycles and growing seasons of certain species, which can in their turn affect how ecosystems function. The equilibrium of ecosystems can also be upset when, for example, insect pests and microbial pathogens, previously unknown in a region, survive the warmer winters. Migrating species may be affected dramatically by any alteration to stop-over sites key to their survival, or when seasonal availability of food sources is no longer in sync with the duration of such migration.
 Changes in the rainfall pattern and temperature can be seen in the Akole and Sangamner villages. Frost in February 2012 in the Akole region was an indication. It will take a long time to see the visible impacts of climate change with reference to shift in ecosystem/habitats. Yet, changes in the habitat due to agricultural expansion are clearly visible. Also observed is the shift in habitat amongst species habitat generalist species like Pied Bushchat, Indian Black Robin, etc., are also spreading into forested ecosystems. Moisture indicators like moss and lichen have been observed to be disappearing from trees or rocks around the villages where these were once abundant. These are clear indications of changing climate.

Green revolution strategies - manufacture of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, development of High Yielding Varieties (HYV) of hybrid seeds, and ensuring that farming communities had access to these at subsidised prices, coupled with large-scale canal irrigation systems, has led towards increase in food production and helped India meet the national food-production goals (Ziegler, 2006). Additionally, employment oriented drought-proofing programmes, together with watershed approaches and extension activities such as agricultural credit-cooperatives, and increased food productivity contributed towards this end in the rain-fed areas of the country. While these ensured self-sourcing at the micro level by improving farming and agriculture, the openmarket and non open-market distribution system ensured food-access to urban and rural areas on a macro scale. The Public Distribution System (PDS), a nationwide network of low priced food grain shops regulated by public authorities, plays an important role in providing access to the urban and rural poor. In addition, targeted programmes such as Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) and Mid-day Meals in school programme were started to reach out to the vulnerable, especially children  and pregnant women. This was a major shift in the policy focus, from mere supply of food to a child-care approach, aiming at provision of nutritious food to children through schools, and providing neo-natal and post-natal care, including facilitation of institutional, rather than home-based, birthing service.",23_WOTR-FNS-Paper-Final.pdf,NA

On the micro level, these steps ensured self-sourcing by improved farming and agriculture; on the macro level, food access to urban and rural areas was ensured by the open-market and non-open market distribution systems. However, after initial successes, India soon started experiencing the limitations of resource-intensive and chemicalsbased agriculture. The pursuit of increasing production and widespread inappropriate use of chemicals has degraded land  resulting in lowering in-situ productivity2. This has dragged farmers and cultivators into a vicious cycle of worsening land degradation with increasing chemical inputs, leading to further degradation of the ecosystems. This, together with the dependency on highyielding variety (HYV) of grain, has led to an ever-increasing dependence on external inputs which is making agriculture unviable.

Processing prolongs the shelf life of food and makes it available over distances; it is useful in reducing the burden on women, making cooking easier. However, the nutritional value of the food is reduced during the manufacturing process, though attempts are made to add supplements. Increased international trade in the wake of the globalisation, and de-regulation under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), has intensified this process. The food-processing industry invests heavily in the promotion of processed foods. In the recent past, these markets have also penetrated rural areas where there is a limited requirement but a growing inclination towards buying and consuming processed food. Processed food is like a two-edged sword for rural areas. On the one hand it reduces the nutritional value of food during the manufacturing process, and on the other it promotes monoculture through contract farming. Monoculture farming is vulnerable to losses due to weather variations. Processed food changes traditional food habits, and together with monoculture, results in loss of diversity of locally available nutritious food that is consumed. It has greatly reduced the agro-biodiversity and the diversity of food grown on farms - both of which are local, climate friendly, and are a fall-back in times of weather variation. Contract farming for processed foods promotes mono-cultivation which affects soil health. Farmers of the Akole block of Ahmednagar district have indicated that during the last six to seven years, traditional crops (finger millet, native paddy and others) have been reduced to 25 per cent of what was grown earlier. Now external varieties of paddy (that have a better market) replace these.

The projections pertaining to temperature increase indicate major declines in agriculture production, especially in rice and wheat (MOEF, 2012; Kelkar and Bhadwal, 2007), as
 also in cash crops. Adverse temperature and moisture conditions would result in yield losses and would affect quality of food grains as well. Sudden variations in temperature, e.g. frost, can destroy crops overnight. India is among 27 countries that are most vulnerable to increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as heat waves, storm surges, droughts, floods, etc. that can hamper or wash away crops.
 > Forest-based Food Sources: The process of degradation of forests would be hastened due to climate change impacts. Changing rainfall patterns and temperature shifts can increase erosion of already degraded forests and lower yields of the many forest based leafy or wild vegetables and mushrooms and other types of food. It is also feared the climate change impacts will reduce the restoration possibilities of forest ecosystems to the original state. As it is, afforestation programmes suffer from poor planning, have a bias towards promoting monocultures of alien species, and deny access to local communities.

Many farmers have experienced the disappointment of carefully raising a crop only to have it damaged or destroyed by an invasion of pests. The practice generally carried out by farmers in such situations is to spray crops heavily with pesticides. This results in significantly higher input costs for farmers, not to mention health and environment hazards. Thus, there is a need for more environmentally friendly pest control methods. One such system is the Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which is an eco-friendly approach that aims at keeping pest population at manageable levels, with minimal use of pesticides. Instead, it employs a combination of alternate pest control methods and techniques with emphasis on the use of bio-pesticides and pesticides of plant-origin like Neem formulations. One village that is seeing this kind of transition to the use of nature friendly bird perches is the Chincholi village of Jalna district, Maharashtra. Agriculture is a mainstay of the village and cotton is the main cash crop. Gajanan Hiwale, a farmer from the village owns four acres of land on which he grows soybean, cotton and chickpea. The story of Gajanan focusses on the issue of farmers distress due to the exorbitant price of chemical pesticides. Earlier, Gajanan grew soybean, cotton and maize on his field, but his crops suffered much due to the attacks of leaf-eating caterpillar and girdle beetle on soybean, sucking pests on cotton, white grub on maize and pod borer on chickpea. He says, used to spend around Rs. 9-10,000 on chemicalpesticidesformy1.5 acre chickpea plot. To buy pesticides, I had to go to Rajur market i.e. 10 km away from my village. I have also heard about the health issues due to these chemical pesticides which made me even more apprehensive, but I was not aware of what I could do.To address this issue. It was found that farmers were using chemical pesticides to an excessive degree, leading to deterioration in the soil health. For the next few seasons, Use and benefits of intercropping of bird perches in 10 to 12 'demo plots' of farmers in every village. The project was not just limited to the use of bird perches. The use of biocontrol agents, bio-pesticides, and integrated pest-disease management techniques were also taught in farm field schools (FFS). In Gajanan had attended the FFS in 2016 and after learning about the bird perches, he grew sorghum (bird perches) with chickpea (main crop) in his field. He says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Earlier, I used to spray chemical pesticides three times a year; but now I just spray it two times or sometimes less than that also, rest of the pests are taken care by sorghum (bird perches) grown in my field. The birds who come to eat the Sorghum also end up eating the pod borer pests, thus controlling their spread. it gave him an apt solution for my pest problem because my annual expenditure has reduced by about 30% for my chickpea crop since I started using the bird perches. In Jalna district, the problems of pod borer and army worm infestation are severe, and hence both organic practices and bird perches farming are needed to reduce the frequency of chemical spraying.when farmers saw the benefits of using bird perches with their own eyes, they themselves started taking it up. Currently, over 40 farmers in Chincholi village are practicing integrated pest management.",Ecologic_July-2019.pdf,NA

 Sub Category:Crop Sequencing and Productivity Optimization",Cropping Systems Involving Pulses," > It is a form of multiple cropping in which crops are grown in sequence on the same field, with the succeeding crop planted after harvest of the preceding crop. This system with relatively short growing season crops offers better total annual use of land than a single crop system. The prominent sequential cropping systems involving different pulses have been discussed crop wise.
 > Rice-Chickpea/ Lentil/ Fieldpea : With the development of wheat varieties amenable for late-planting upto late December and January, the area under rice-wheat system has increased at a faster rate in the last two decades. The adverse effect of this system on soil health is being widely recognized. In recent years, development of early maturing varieties of chickpea suitable for planting up to mid of December with yield potential of 15-20 q/ ha has enabled farmers to adopt rice-chickpea system instead of cereal-cereal system especially in the tail end of command areas in eastern U.P. and Bihar. Similarly on the upland of Punjab, Haryana and western U.P., where cotton is grown as commercial crop, chickpea can be successfully introduced. Under resource constraint particularly irrigation water, chickpea is more remunerative than wheat. In low land areas of eastern region, lentil proved to be better one over chickpea. The major constraints in fast spread of this system are limited choice of improved varieties and incidence of pod borer, botrytis gray mold, Ascochyta blight besides poor soil tilth and nodulation.
 > Pigeonpea - Wheat : Pigeonpea is a major crop of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat. In the irrigated areas of the northern and central India, pigeonpea-wheat has emerged as a promising system. Availability of short duration varieties such as UPAS 120, Manak, ICPL 151, Pusa 992, w hich takes abou t 120-160 d ays to mature has enabled their introduction in rice-wheat irrigated area of western U.P., Punjab and Haryana, Delhi and North-East Rajasthan. This has provided desired stability and sustainability to produ tivity of cereal based cropping system. But there are some issues, Pusa 992- a short duration variety of pigeonpea which need to be tackled for wider adoptability and profitability from this system. Presently, most of the short duration varieties of pigeonpea available for cultivation are affected by sterility mosaic, fusarium wilt and Phytophthora blight and have tendency to prolong maturity with the late monsoon. Therefore, development of varieties, which could mature by early November with 2 t yield/ ha is required. In Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Orissaand Assam, pigeonpea is being grown as a pre-rabi after kharif maize, early rice, minor millets or jute but due to its sensitivity to temperature, it has promise only in the areas having mild winter.
 > Rice - Urdbean/Mungbean/ Lathyrus : Cultivation of rabi urdbean and mungbean in coastal regions of South India is being practiced since long but it could get momentum only after development of powdery mildew resistant genotypes such as LBG 17, LBG 402, LBG 611 and LBG 22 having high yield potential. Development of these varieties in late eighties has revolutionized urdbean and mungbean cultivation in rice fallow especially in Andhra Pradesh. This system is highly productive and stable besides its benefits through improvement in soil health. This cropping system is now being practiced in other states like Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

 Sub Category:Intercropping Methods for Pulse Production",Cropping Systems Involving Pulses,"> The utera/paira, a type of cropping which is commonly practiced in Bihar, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal Chattisgarh and Orissa is a kind of relay method of sowing in which lentil/ lathyrus/ urdbean/ mungbean seeds are broadcast in the standing crop of rice about 2 week before its harvest. This practice enables to use better soil moisture available at the time of harvesting of rice crop, which could otherwise be lost quickly. Experimental evidences showed that paira cropping produced more yield of lentil than planting with tillage after harvesting of the rice crop. Utera system does not allow agronom ic intervention such as tillage, weeding, irrigation and fertilizer application. However, rice variety decides the productivity of pulses in this system. There are certain issues which need to be resolved for better p rod u ctivity and p rofitability. Available variety of rice are long duration and photosensitive, seed ling m ortality causes inadequate plant population, rare use of fertilizer, weed infestation due to lack of post emergence herbicides and moisture stress at the terminal stage. Most of the area of South eastern Uttar Pradesh in Vindhyan region is rainfed and chickpea is grown after rice. Sowing of chickpea is generally delayed by 10-15 days when sown after the harvest of the rice for soil to reach proper moisture after pre-sowing irrigation and for seedbed preparation. Due to this,
 delayed sowing of chickp ea in the end of November may cause heavy reduction in chickpea yield. Sowing of chickpea by Utera method in standing rice crop (about 10 days before rice harvest) gave 45% higher yield than the sowing after proper seed bed preparation (Tripathi, 1986).The development of zero till drill has now facilitated sowing of wheat/ chickpea / lentil immediately after harvesting of rice in moist soil.",Pulses in Cropping Systems,NA

 Sub Category:Soil Fertility Management",Effect of Pulses on System Productivity and N Economy,"> It has been estimated that 668,000 tonnes of nitrogen can be incorporated in the soil through the inclusion of legumes in cropping systems. The intrinsic nitrogen fixing capacity of pulse crops enables them to meet large proportion of their nitrogen requirement and also helps in economizing nitrogen in succeeding non-legume crops due to the residual effect. Different legumes have different capacity to leave behind varying amounts of N for use by the succeeding crops. In sequential cropping involving pulses, the preceding pulse may contribute 18-70 kg N/ ha to the soil and thereby considerable amount of nitrogen to succeeding crop. The beneficial effect of pulses was more pronounced in maize as compared to sorghum after chickpea and pigeonpea whereas after lentil and peas the higher N- equivalent benefit was observed after pearlmillet . Growing of short duration legumes such as green gram and cowpea in widely spaced crops and ploughing back the same in the soil after picking the grains resulted in an advantage of 30 kg N/ ha on fertilizer basis in Alfisol of Hyderabad. Incorporation of crop residue of mungbean in rice-wheat system not only added 100 kg N/ ha to the soil but also maintained high availability of N during various growth stages of rice. In a three-year experiment on sandy loam soil of Kanpur, Kushwaha and Ali reported significant improvement in productivity and N economy in wheat preceded by kharif legumes. Cowpea was most beneficial followed by pigeonpea and pigeonpea + mungbean. Soybean - wheat system was most productive followed by pigeonpea - mungbean - wheat among kharif pulse based cropping systems. The nitrogen economy due to preceding pigeonpea over sorghum was 51 kg N equivalent/ ha. Influence of rabi pulses on productivity and N economy in succeeding rice revealed that chickpea and lentil exhibited most favourable effect in economizing nitrogen to the extent of 40 kg/ ha. Among summer pulses, mungbean - rice was most productive (6620 kg/ ha) followed by fodder cowpea - rice , which was mainly attributed to the residual effect of nitrogen by the legumes. In Oxisols of Vamban, highest grain yield was recorded in cowpea - maize sequence followed by urdbean - maize. The superiority of cowpea as preceding summer pulse was attributed to its higher N fixation capacity and higher addition of plant residues in the soil, which enriched the soil fertility and promoted the growth of succeeding crop .

 Sub Category:Soil Management and Crop Rotation",Effect of Pulses on System Productivity and N Economy,"> Physical properties : Aggregate stability is an important soil quality parameter, which can be used as an index to compare the long-term shift in soil quality. Crop rotations that included pulses are generally beneficial to aggregate stability and formation of favourable soil structure. The fungi present in the pulse crop rhizosphere produces a glycoprotein called Glomalin. The sticky part of glomalin entraps soil mineral, organic matter and debris to form stable soil aggregates. Hence, microbial activity of rhizosphere is directly responsible for the improved soil structure in crop rotations involving pulses. In a long-term rotational experiment, higher percentage of soil aggregates exceeding 0.25 mm were recorded where preceding crop was a legume. Bulk density is another soil quality parameter, which responds to change in management over a long period of time. In crop sequences which returns sizeable amount of residues to soil usually result in lower bulk density . Incorporation of mungbean stover in rice-wheat- m u ngbean sequ ence resu lted in low er bu lk d ensity and hydraulic conductivity . Legume roots being rich in nitrogen content and having ability of deep penetration in the soil also encou rage earthworm activity. The root channels and earthw orm bu rrow s increase soil p orosity promoting air movements and w ater p ercolation deep into the soil. Results of AICPIP (All India Coord inated Pulses Impovement Project) revealed that soil physico-chemical properties at the end of 7th crop cycle improved significantly in the crop sequences wherever mungbean or urdbean were involved in the sequence. Chemical properties Soil pH : Pulse crops have the ability to reduce the pH of soil in the rhizosphere and make micro-environment favourable for nutrient availability. Since pulses acquire a greater part of their nitrogen requirement from the air as diatomic nitrogen rather than from the soil as NO3, their net effect is to lower the pH of soil. Some of the legumes like alfalfa and soybean can reduce the pH of soil by one complete unit. Among grain legumes, chickpea reduces the pH most followed by pea and pigeonpea. This reduction in pH of the soil helps to create favourable soil environment especially in neutral and alkaline soil environments and also to increase the nutrient availability and microbial activity. The reduction of pH becomes clearer with intense growth period. Build up of Organic matter and nutrients : Pulses add significant amount of organic residues to the soil in the form of root biomass and leaf litter. Roots and leaf litter being rich in N facilitate decomposition of crop residues in soil and increases microbial activity. Rabi pulses contributed 7-14 kg N, 3-5 kg P and 8-20 kg K/ ha. Pigeonpea added 8-16 kg N, 2.5-5.0 kg P and 13.5-24.0 kg K/ ha through leaf drop in the entire crop growth cycle. In a study conducted over three years, mungbean green manuring or incorporation of mungbean stover after picking of pods in rice- wheat system considerably improved the available P status of soil, due to root exudates capable of mobilizing sparingly soluble P in soil (Saxena 1995). Study conducted at Pantnagar showed significant improvement in organic carbon and total N due to substitution of one cereal component with legumes (Table 9). Pulses by virtue of their several characteristics have been found the best choice for diversifying the cereal based cropping systems to sustain the cropping systems. Availability of varieties having diverse characteristics and their role in soil amelioration has resulted into identifications of several remunerative and more productive cropping systems. Nitrogen : It is well documented that pulses leave behind substantial amount of N in soil after their harvest. An improvement in the N budget of soil measured by improved mineralizable organic N and microbial biomass C and N has been reported by many workers. Nitrate nitrogen left after harvest of rabi pulses were estimated and chickpea ranked first (20.4 kg/ ha) followed by fieldpea and lentil in contribution of residual NO3 in the soil profile. Among the genotypes, chickpea cv. BG 1003, lentil cv. DPL 62 and fieldpea cv. Rachana were highest in increasing the nitrate content. Kharif pulses also increased the soil NO3 by 4-8 kg/ ha. Reduced use of soil nitrate is the reason for this extra nitrate during the growth of pulses (nitrate sparing effect). Phosphorus : Inclusion of legume in cropping system not only economizes nitrogen requirement of cropping system but also helps in efficient utilization of native phosphorus due to secretion of certain acids that helps in solubilization of various forms of phosphorus. This capacity of legumes makes them efficient in native utilization of phosphorus present in different forms. Increased available P is a result of P acquisition from insoluble phosphates through root exudates. Chickpea has the ability to access P normally not available to other crops by mobilizing sparingly soluble Ca-P by acidification of rhizospere through its citric acid root exudates in Vertisols and pigeonpea have been characterized for dissolution of Fe-P in Alfisol . Biological properties : Pulses are known to improve the microbial environment in the soils. They are known to release a part of unused nitrate fixed through symbiotic nitrogen fixation to the soil. Also low molecular weight organic compounds are released to the soil as exudates. This serves as a substrate to soil microorganisms resulting in the build up of population of soil microbes. Experimental results have revealed the higher microbial population in rice-wheat system due to inclusion of mungbean in the system when compared to fallow. Similarly in maize based system, maize-wheat-mungbean recorded highest soil microbial biomass carbon as compared to maize-wheat ( Table 10). Dehydrogenase enzyme activity, an index of soil microbial activity was also found to increase in soil after pulse crop. These increases in microbial activity in turn influence mineralization and immobilization of nutrients like N, P and S depending upon the environment. These results indicate that inclusion of pulses in crop rotation improves soil microbial biomass and their activity that could be vital for long-term soil health and productivity.

Application of phosphorus to chickpea was beneficial to succeeding rice giving a substitution effect of 20-30 kg P2O5/ ha when compared with P applied to rice in rice-chickpea sequence. Rhizobium and application of 40 kg P2O5/ ha in chickpea besides increasing chickpea yield also increased the yield of succeeding maize and fodder crops significantly. In urdbean Ã¢â‚¬â€œ wheat sequence, a net saving of 25% of fertilizer could be made in wheat reported that application of kg P/ ha to the preceding pigeonpea significantly increased the growth, yield attributes as well as yield of succeeding wheat over no P application. The direct application of P to wheat at 17.2 kg/ ha was at par with that of 34.4 kg/ ha, which showed that 50% of P requirement could be saved. pigeonpea made use of phosphate residues more effectively than wheat in this system. In chickpea-upland rice system in Alfisol of Hyderabad, direct effect of P was limited only up to 20 kg P in case of chickpea, the maximum residual response to kharif upland rice was significant upto 40 kg P/ ha. From this, it appears that even chickpea feeds better on native P source leaving lot of residual P to succeeding crops. Response to sulphur up to 20 kg/ ha was also noticed in chickpea to sustain the yield of both the crops in rice-chickpea system. In case the sulphur is applied to pigeonpea, its application could be omitted to the succeeding wheat crop without any loss in the grain yield . Based on 2 year field studies in pigeonpea-wheat sequence, application of RDF + Zn+B+Mo to pigeonpea recorded significant residual effect on yield of wheat (5000 kg/ ha) as compared to control (4000 kg/ ha). Pigeonpea equivalent yield was also found highest (3148 kg/ ha) in this treatment. Inclusion of pulse crop in a cropping system itself acts as a component of integrated nutrient management and benefits arising out of this are very much comparable to the benefits obtained from any other organic manure. Application of 5 t FYM/ ha significantly increased the seed yield of pigeonpea and residual effect of FYM resulted in significant increase in grain yield of wheat in pigeonpea  wheat system. Rice  chickpea system was found most productive and profitable system (Rs. 30,777/ - net returns/ ha) with 60 kg P2O5/ ha applied to rice, 40 kg P2O5/ ha applied to chickpea along with 5 t compost/ ha applied to rice.

Residual effect of kharif applied S was not conspicuous where there was no direct application of S to chickpea. Crop residue application increased the sorghum yield by 26% in sorghum + pigeonpea intercropping system. The residue management studies of kharif mungbean indicated a yield gain in rabi crop to the extent of 15.6%. Further, incorporation of mungbean residue substituted 50% NPK requirement of rabi sorghum. ",Pulses in Cropping Systems,NA

 Sub Category: Intercropping Nutrient Management",Agricultural Practices,"> The dilemma of nutrient management under intercropping system arises due to differences in nutrient requirement of intercrops and also due to biological nitrogen contribution from pulses. Biological efficiency is likely to improve when legumes are included in the cropping system as intercropping because they explore the same soil mass more thoroughly, compared to sole cropping and may be able to take up the nutrients from a place and a form which are inaccessible (Saraf and Patil 1995). Multi-locational trials on mode of fertilizer application in pigeonpea based intercropping system showed that recommended dose for the cereal component of the system is sufficient to achieve yield of component crops almost equivalent to those obtained with the recommended dose of nutrient applied to both the components. In
 general, application of 50% of recommended dose of N for cereal and full quantity of phosphorus and potash required for the system at the time of sowing and remaining dose of N a month after sowing would be optimum for pigeonpea + cereal intercropping system. The basal dose of N meets the initial demand of cereal and legume, afterwards, biologically fixed N will be available to both pigeonpea and intercrop component. In wheat + chickpea intercropping system, Ali (1993) reported that application of normal recommended dose of fertilizer to wheat only was as efficient as applying doses to both the crops indicating that fertilizer applied to wheat were adequate to meet the requirement of associated chickpea also. chickpea in intercropping system was not influenced by N levels but was responsive to P applied upto 60 kg P2O5/ ha. In pigeonpea + urdbean intercropping, application of recommended dose of fertilizer to pigeonpea alone was significantly more effective and it met the initial requirement of fertilizer for urdbean . Benefit: Cost ratio was higher when blackgram supplied with no fertilizer or 50% of recommended fertilizer was intercropped with maize given with recommended fertilizer @ 120:26.4:33.2 kg NPK/ ha. Spatial arrangement and nutrient application in chickpea based intercropping systems across various centres of AICRP on Pulses revealed that intercropping of chickpea + mustard (6:1) along with 75% recommended dose of fertilizers recorded higher chickpea equivalent yield than sole crop of chickpea.",Pulses in Cropping Systems,NA

 Sub Category:Sequential Cropping Strategies for Sustainable Agriculture",Pulses: Component of RCT," > Sequential cropping is a kind of multiple cropping system in which two or more crops are grown in a sequence on same land within a crop year, one crop being sown after the harvest of the other. Pulses in the cereal/oilseed based cropping systems are introduced to break the monotony of crop rotation. Pulses being rainfed low input crop provide safeguard against crop failure due to poor rainfall and adverse weather conditions. Apart from enriching soil fertility, introduction of pulses in cropping system also improves nitrogen economy. Early pigeonpea-wheat sequence was evaluated and found promising than traditional rice-wheat cropping system in irrigated areas of Punjab, Haryana, central and western Uttar Pradesh by advancing the pigeonpea sowing to May-June or earlier. Early pigeonpea genotypes UPAS 120, Pusa 992, Manak, AL 15, AL 201 and ICPL 88039 were found promising for this cropping system. Inclusion of pulses in rice-wheat system increased the system productivity besides improving the soil fertility. Inclusion of rabi pulses significantly increased the productivity of succeeding rice crop in comparison to wheat. In a three years study, the highest yield of rice (4,912 kg/ha) was obtained after preceding crop of rajmash which was at par with chickpea, lentil and fieldpea and significantly higher over wheat. Crop rotation involving rabi pulses particularly rajmash, chickpea and field pea economized N to the tune of 40 kg/ha over wheat and considerably increased total economic yield under irrigated condition. Similarly, the yield of wheat was improved significantly after kharif legumes especially mungbean, soybean and groundnut than maize.Inclusion of short duration catch crop in summer like mungbean not only provide a bonus yield of 700-1000 kg/ha, but also economises nitrogen in the subsequent rice crop to the tune of 34 kg/ha. Among the summer legumes, the highest improvement in system productivity was recorded with mungbean, followed by fodder cowpea and urdbean. In low land areas of eastern UP, Bihar and parts of MP, where excess moisture after harvest of rice poses serious problem, rust resistant high yielding lentil varieties have been found suitable for rice-lentil sequence. Under this situation, two bold seeded lentil genotypes (K 75 and DPL 62) and two small seeded genotypes (Pant L 4076 and IPL 81) were found most suitable. However, in relay cropping system rice - lathyrus was found most remunerative, followed by rice-linseed.
 > Development of early maturing chickpea varieties suitable for planting upto mid-December with higher yield potential (1,500-2,000 kg/ha) has enabled the farmers to adopt rice-chickpea sequence instead of cereal-cereal systems especially in the tail end of command areas in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. After three years of research experiments, rice genotype NDR 359 and chickpea genotype BG 256 recorded significantly higher rice equivalent yield (10,633 kg/ha), net return and benefit cost ratio. Among the 10 AVT lines of chickpea along with two checks (DCP 92-3 and BG 372) for their suitability under rice-chickpea sequence, IPC 2005- 61 recorded maximum yield (2,793 kg/ha), followed by DCP 92-3 (2, 790 kg/ha) and found most suitable for rice , chickpea sequential cropping. Short duration high yielding varieties like Uday, Amber, HUR 15 and HUR 137 of rajmash have been successfully introduced in the central and eastern plain zone under irrigated condition. Cropping sequence like rajmash- mungbean and rajmash urdbean were found most remunerative (gross return Rs. 38,963/ha). The yield of summer legumes after rajmash was higher than that after wheat and chickpea mainly due to timely planting. Among the six rice-pulses cropping system under lowland irrigated conditions, rice-rajmash-mungbean was found most productive (5,210 kg/ha) and remunerative (Rs. 37,515/ha), followed by rice-wheat- mungbean (4,644 kg/ha and Rs. 33,842 /ha) . However, B: C ratio of rice- lentil (2.64) and rice - field pea (2.38) was higher than other crop sequences probably due to low input cost as compared to other pulses. It was also observed that the yield of summer legumes after rajmash was higher than that after wheat and chickpea mainly due to timely planting. In a long-term study, significantly highest system productivity in terms of chickpea equivalent yield (CEY) was recorded in case of rice-wheat-mungbean (10,050 kg/ha), followed by rice-chickpea (8264 kg/ha) and rice-chickpea-rice-wheat (7305 kg/ha) systems over rice-wheat.

The most common goal of intercropping is to produce a greater yield on a given piece of land by making use of resources that would otherwise not be utilized by a single crop. Pulses are generally intercropped with coarse cereals and oilseeds under rainfed condition in our country. The slow initial growth habit and deep tap root system makes these crops more suitable for intercropping with cereals and oilseed crops than any other crop. Apart from increasing profitability and resource use efficiency, pulses as intercrop act as safeguard under unprecedented moisture stress condition. Studies conducted at IIPR have also revealed that introduction of pulses as intercrop could reduce the disease and weed intensity. 
 > Kharif pulses : The early maturing cereals such as sorghum, maize and millets accumulate dry matter and utilized resources during the initial slow growth period of pigeonpea offer a good option for intercropping with long duration pigeonpea. As the reproductive growth of these intercrops does not coincide with pigeonpea, the yield of cereals is not affected adversely. After harvest of cereals, pigeonpea growth is compensated and additional pigeonpea yield is obtained. In sorghum + pigeonpea intercropping system, the highest pigeonpea grain yield (2,676 kg/ha), PEY (3,146 kg/ha), net return (Rs. 43,303 kg/ha) and B: C ratio (3.6) were recorded with 2:1 row ratio.

Among the two spatial arrangements (2:1 and 2:2) for intercropping pigeonpea + urdbean, 2:1 row ratio was found better.
 In early pigeonpea + groundnut intercropping system, 2:2 row ratio with row orientation in NorthÃ¢â‚¬â€œSouth direction was found most productive (1,238 kg pigeonpea equivalent yield/ha) and increased land use efficiency by 90%. The companion crops viz., urdbean, mungbean, cowpea, soybean and sorghum of pigeonpea appreciably suppressed the weed flora under both uniform and paired row planting. However, weed suppression under uniform row planting (1:1) was considerably higher (30.8%) than paired row planting (16.7%), mainly due to closer sowing. Among companion crops, cowpea was found to be the most effective with 43.4% weed suppression under uniform row planting and 22.6% under paired row system. Pearl millet + urdbean and pearl millet + mungbean particularly under paired row system (2:1) were found to be highly productive and efficient (LER >2).
 > Rabi pulses : Chickpea, lentil and rajmash also offer suitable options for intercropping with cereals and oilseeds. Kabuli chickpea + barley in 3:1 row ratio recorded maximum productivity and higher LER (1.3) as compared to sole crops. Similarly, chickpea + linseed intercropping was found highly productive and profitable than their sole cropping. Wheat + chickpea intercropping under 2:2 ratio was found more productive (4769 kg wheat equivalent yield/ha) and LER of 1.20 than two other row ratios. Application of recommended dose of fertilizer only to wheat was as efficient as applying the fertilizer to both crops.Among three genotypes (BG 256, KPG 59 and KWR 108) and three spatial arrangements (2:1, 4:2 and 6:2), BG 256 with 6:2 row ratio of chickpea + linseed (Neelam) was found most productive (CEY 2,609 kg/ha), profitable
 (Rs.18, 531 / ha) and efficient (LER 1.48) as compared to others . Similarly, kabuli chickpea cv. KAK 2 with mustard cv. Vardan was found most compatible for intercropping. Under late sown condition (first week of December), wheat + chickpea intercropping under 2:2 row ratio was found more productive (4769 kg/ha wheat equivalent yield) and LER (1.20) than the sole crop of either wheat or chickpea. Lentil and linseed make perfect combination for intercropping as compared to other rabi crops in rainfed conditions. Under lentil + linseed intercropping system, lentil variety PL 4076 with 6:2 row ratio was found more compatible than DPL 62 and recorded maximum productivity in terms of lentil equivalent yield (2171 kg/ ha) and land use efficiency (21% higher) Rajmash + potato intercropping has been found quite profitable and efficient in irrigated areas of central Uttar Pradesh. On the basis of rajmash equivalent yield, intercropping of rajmash + potato was more productive and efficient under all planting geometry as compared to sole rajmash. However, the highest productivity (3956 kg/ha) was obtained under 3:2 row ratio of potato + rajmash intercropping system with 48% increase in land use efficiency (Table 5). Among intercrops, rajmash + linseed in 1:1 row ratio at 45 cm spacing proved most efficient with LER of 1.79 and also recorded highest yield (1753 kg/ha). Similarly, rajmash + wheat in 5:1 , row ratio was found efficient.

Structural degradation, loss of organic matter, erosion and falling biodiversity are all to be expected. Soil erosion resulting from soil tillage has forced us to look for alternatives and to reverse the process of soil degradation. This led to promote conservation tillage, and especially zero-tillage in many parts of the world. Over the last two decades the technologies have been improved and accepted by the farmers in our country, mostly in Indo-Gangetic plains. Conservation tillage involves the planting, growing and  harvesting of crops with minimal disturbance to the soil surface. Conservation tillage (CT) is designed to reduce erosion and maintain or improve soil health and infiltration by reducing surface sealing and enhancing macropores connectivity and flow. A study on rabi crops viz., lentil, fieldpea, fababean, lathyrus and chickpea sown under zero as well as conventional tillage after rice harvest revealed that all pulses performed equally well under both tillage practices. Similarly in another set of study, performance of chickpea sown after rice in zero tillage (ZT) was at par with conventional tillage, however, retention of rice residue on surface had advantage over no-residue in zero tillage. Soil moisture dynamics was also worked out under the same set of study which revealed that initial depletion of soil moisture is higher under zero tillage, while at flowering and pod filling stages zero tillage + mulching retained higher soil moisture which lead to higher yield of chickpea under rainfed conditions.","Resource Conservation

 Sub Category:Crop Residue Incorporation and Soil Improvement",Residue Management and Pulses,"> Crop residues are portions of plants remaining after seed harvest. Residues are important in nutrient distribution and plant growth and they affect the amount of soil nutrients available to crops. Plant residues influence N cycling in soils because they are primary sources and sinks for C and N. Residues allow N to be available to plants for longer period of time through initially immobilizing, and then gradually mineralizing N. However, in many parts of the tropics, crop residues are burnt in the field due to the ignorance of farmers about their value and lack of proper technology for in situ incorporation of residues . One tonne straw on burning releases 3 kg particulate matter, 60 kg CO, 1460 kg CO2, 199 kg ash and 2 kg SO4-2. Pulses also contribute to soil organic matter by leaf litter. It was observed that long duration pigeonpea in northern India can add up to 2.8 t/ha leaf litter during whole crop season, whereas chickpea up to 1.7 t/ha. On an average, nutrients contribution by these leaf litters varies between 8-15 kg N, 2.5-5.0 kg P and 8-24 kg K per hectare. Besides supplementing the fertilizers, incorporation of crop residues is also important for improvement of soil properties and thereby increasing productivity and fertilizer use efficiency. In rice-chickpea sequence, yield of chickpea was significantly influenced by rice-residue incorporation and highest seed yield was obtained with incorporation of chopped straw + irrigation + 20 kg N/ha, while lowest yield was obtained in rice residue removal treatment. Incorporation of chopped residue of mungbean + irrigation + 20 kg N/ha resulted in maximum wheat yield (4495 kg/ha) which was significantly higher (38%) than control. Incorporation of urdbean and mungbean residue raised the organic carbon level by 35.48% over control. Residue incorporation also resulted in higher soil available N (24.6%), P (11.5%), and K (18.5%) over the initial
 fertility levels. Soil physical parameters measured viz., bulk density, particle density, percent pore space and WHC also improved under residue incorporation plots over residue removal plots (Table 11). In same set of study, periodic changes in soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) were also recorded. The results revealed increase in SMBC up to 56 days after incorporation of urdbean and mungbean under chopping + incorporation + irrigation (Table 12). Similar trend was also observed after harvest of wheat crop. The ratio of microbial carbon to soil organic carbon was also higher under chopping + incorporation + irrigation.","Resource Conservation

The timeliness of operations and increasing precision in input application with minimum cost demand for more use of farm machinery. The various operations such as land preparation, leveling, sowing planting, irrigation, fertilizers application , plant protection, harvesting and threshing need a high degree of precision to increase the efficiency of the inputs and reduce the losses. For example, sowing of the required quantity of seed at proper depth and uniform application of given dose of fertilizer can only be possible with the use of proper mechanical devices. However, when such operations are performed through indigenous methods, their efficiency is reduced. The time taken to perform sequence of operations is a factor determining the cropping intensity. To ensure timeliness of various operations, it is quite inevitable to use such mechanical equipments which have higher output capacity and cut down the number of operations to be performed. This has helped in increasing area under cultivation and cropping intensity. The benefits of mechanization can be utilized not only by the farmers having large holdings, but even farmers with small holdings can utilize selected improved farm equipments through custom hiring to increase productivity and reduce cost of production. The development, standardization and adoption of suitable farm machinery for conservation agriculture including seeding with minimum soil disturbance keeping residue maintained on the soil surface and developing harvesting equipment are of major concern. To fetch the benefit of CA, the machinery suitable to CA must be adapted to small landholder farmers and to different ecological conditions.

It is one of the most intensely farmed areas and is popularly known as food bowl of India due to its high contribution in production of cereal crops, especially rice and wheat. It produces around 50 percent of the total food production of which lentil production is close to 70 percent of the total production in the country. Wheat producing states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Punjab, which along with Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, collectively contribute around 90 percent of total wheat production in the country are from the IGP region. The leading rice producing states, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and West Bengal, are from the IGP region and together produce close to 35 percent of the total rice production in the country. NITI Aayog has, on the basis of agro-climatic zones, divided this area into four major sub regions: trans Gangetic plain; upper Gangetic plain; middle Gangetic plain; and lower Gangetic plain. The present study has focused on districts from upper- Gangetic plains and middleGangetic plains. Both regions are known for fertile soils, favourable climate and generally abundant supply of water. The concentration of small and marginal farmers with small land holdings is very high in these regions. The major crops grown in this area are rice, wheat, maize, chickpea, lentil, mustard, potato, sugarcane and vegetables. Rice- and wheat-based cropping systems cover most of the area from these two regions which can be attributed to climate suitability, better adaptability, availability of high yielding varieties and increasing mechanization of both crops. The productivity of most crops in this region is close to their yield potential due to the presence of favourable agro-climatic conditions including productive alluvial soil, maximum irrigated land, sub-tropical climate, etc. Agricultural practices adopted by farmers are highly input intensive with higher usage of resources such as fertilizer and water which contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well. IGP is significant from the point of production of major food grain crops. Characterized by a favourable climate, fertile soils and abundant water supply, IGP is seen as the bread basket of South Asia, providing food and livelihood security for hundreds of millions of its inhabitants3. It is also known as India “bowl of food grains because it contributes 48.4 percent of rice and 74.7 percent of wheat of the total Indian production of these two major food grains crops. Most areas of these plains have two to three crops in a year. Wheat, potato and mustard are the major crops of the spring (Rabi) season and paddy is grown in autumn (Kharif) season4. The climatic trends of IGP show that the temperature of this region is increasing year by year. According to a weather trend variability analysis done for the IGP region, the average temperature of this region has increased by 0.2 centigrade (C) per decade from the year 1960. The range of possible temperature increase for IGP is 0.6-2.7°C, 0.5-3.1°C and 1.0-5.4°C above the 1070-1999 mean for the 2030s, 2050s and 2090s, respectively. In general, temperatures in the monsoon period increase less than in the dry seasons5. The research indicates that though average precipitation of the plains is static, the timing of precipitation is changing. A study was conducted by the Centre for Environment Science and Climate Resilient Agriculture on assessment of impacts on rice and wheat in IGP7 using the climatic data based on the PRECIS regional climate model developed by the Hadley Centre, United Kingdom, in nine representative locations of IGP. The study suggested the occurrence of extreme temperature events which could cause yield reduction, particularly if these events coincide with sensitive stages of crop growth. Apart from differential growth and yield responses of crop species to high thermal stress, the study also suggested differential response to high temperature stress during various growth phases8. The results indicated that an increase in temperatures adversely influences crop performance and these negative impacts of temperature are not compensated enough by elevated carbon-dioxide (CO2) concentrations as is evident from a reduction in overall projected yields. Results also project occurrence of low yielding years more frequently due to climate change. IGP is an environmentally sensitive, socially significant and economically strategic domain of India where landscape, hydrology and fertility are threatened by climate warming and anthropogenic pressure. A decline in food production will be the major problem. In order to assess environmental changes, concerted efforts should be initiated to understand the geological past and model the future9. Even a rise in temperature by 20C can lead to a fall in farm production between 4 and 34 percent (IPCC, 2007)10. The soil salinity, already prevalent in the plains of Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh, is bound to extend over the marginally saline areas, reducing the availability of agricultural land. This will place additional stress on the already declining water table. Groundwater exploitation is likely to be intensified and consequently water stressed areas will become water scarce. According to another study on the current rice-wheat system scenario in IGP, a good correlation is indicated between rainfall and rice yield as shown by statistical and remote sensing data analysis. The studys findings mention that the current scenario of climate changes, i.e., global warming, rising temperatures, irregular pattern of rainfall, excess use of fertilizers and irregular pattern of irrigation significantly contribute to a decline in the fertility of lands11. The risk of climate change to agriculture is very significant in IGP due to its high dependency on rainfall and its connections to the tectonics and climate of the Himalaya. Thus, any change in these factors will have an adverse effect on the hydrology, soil fertility, food production and settlement patterns of IGP. Incidence of pest and diseases would be most severe in tropical regions due to favourable climate/weather conditions, multiple cropping patterns and availability of alternate pests throughout the year. Climate change is likely to cause a spread of tropical and subtropical weed species into temperate areas and to increase the numbers of many temperate weed species currently limited by the low temperature at high latitudes.India is the third highest GHG emitter. Agriculture and livestock together account for 18 percent of the gross national emissions. It is the third highest emitter after the energy and industry sectors. The growing population necessitates continuous increase in food production while ensuring low carbon footprints of agriculture and livestock. Incidentally, Uttar Pradesh, a prominent state from the IGP region, is also a top agricultural and livestock GHG emitter12. This underscores the importance of climate aligned sustainable agricultural practices. Climate change can have a huge impact across the food processing industry due to its immense dependency on agriculture produce as a raw material. With weather becoming unpredictable, it becomes difficult to foresee industry needs. Climate change and agriculture produce are directly related to the cost of production and hence any risk involved in acquiring agriculture produce will have serious implications on profitability and sustainability of food-based enterprises. Apart from the growers, actors involved in aggregation and collection, transportation and storage, food processors are considered as the value chain actors who add value through a different set of activities. Climate change impacts will occur at all levels of the value chain and individual adaptive responses at each level will either enhance or reduce overall performance in terms of efficiency, continuity and product attributes. This study aims to explore adaptations of small holder farmers with special attention on climate implications and adaptive strategies to value chain actors.","Understanding Climate Change

The study focused on districts that were identified from among the top 37 vulnerable districts from the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh by the National Innovations on  Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA). The vulnerability of the districts and their ranking were determined based on three components. These three components of vulnerability are sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity, identified based on the extent and intensity of the possible climate impact. This study considered climatic, physical and socio- economic factors together to arrive at the vulnerability rating. Eight indicators using gridded meteorological data for the period 1951-2009 were used for computing exposure while sensitivity was computed from six indicators based on crop and soil characteristics. Computation of adaptive capacity has been based on socio-economic indicators of agricultural technology, infrastructure and human development. These spatial datasets of the key indicators contributing to agricultural vulnerability have been generated for the 161 districts in IGP. The study also found that the districts located in the eastern and southern parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were more vulnerable, whereas districts in Punjab and Haryana have low vulnerability due to their higher adaptive capacity to recover from climatic stresses. Hence it was decided to select districts from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar which are also priority states for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This list included 36 districts from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It was also proposed to select districts that are in the list of 'aspirational districts' as identified by NITI Aayog of the Government of India. A total of 115 districts were identified from 28 states with the criteria of at least one from each of the states. The selection of districts was made in a transparent manner by a committee of senior officers of the Government of India in consultation with state officials, using a composite index of key data sets that included deprivation enumerated under the Socio-Economic Caste Census, key health and education sector performance and state of basic infrastructure indicator. Twenty-one of the total 115 districts were from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Based on these two selection criteria, a total of 14 districts were identified (nine from Bihar and five from Uttar Pradesh). The scope of study suggested that two districts each from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh should be included. In the interest of a broader perspective and representation from diversified agro- climatic conditions, it was also decided to select districts from two different agro-climatic zones. Districts common to these two lists were further evaluated based on a framework comprising parameters such as centrality of agriculture, meaning the importance of agriculture as a source of livelihood for the district. Agriculture centrality, Agriculture centrality could be further unpacked as how central it is to the population of the district and how central it is to the geography of the district. Value chain centrality, From the objective of assignment, it became essential to add the districts that had large value addition potential due to production of certain crops. To calculate the value chain centrality, end usage of the commodities produced in the districts were identified. The difference between the value of the commodity produced and its price as raw material and its value after being converted into a consumable product gave us an idea of the value chain possibility within the district.
 As an example, in the case of wheat, district-wise production of wheat was multiplied by the price of wheat which we took as the Minimum Support Price (MSP) declared for the commodity. Based on secondary research, the final usage of wheat was assessed which could be wheat flour, fine flour, rava (suji) and wheat bran. The wholesale price for each of the commodities was multiplied with the proportion of wheat produced in the districts. Through this exercise, the value chain possibilities for all the main crops were identified.Agro-climatic zones, An agro-climatic zone can be defined as the land unit expressed in terms of major climatic conditions suitable for a certain range of crops. Some of these conditions are temperature, rainfall, altitude and soil characteristics. The first two plays an important role in defining the agro-climatic zones. India is classified under 15 agro-climatic zones and 73 sub zones. However, ICAR has delineated India into 127 zones. In addition to the agriculture and value chain centrality, representation of agro-climatic zones in different states was also considered as an important criterion.
 Out of the two states identified for this study, Bihar, with a total geographical area of 9,360,000 hectare (ha), has three important agro-climatic zones. These zones are known as North-West, North-East, and South. Similarly under the National Agricultural Research Project undertaken by the erstwhile Planning Commission (presently known as NITI Aayog) nine agro-climatic zones have been recognized in the state which are Tarai, Western Plain , Mid-Western Plain,South-Western Semi-Dry Plain, Mid Plain, Bundelkhand, North-Eastern Plain, Eastern Plain and ninth as Vindhyan. Table 3 shows the demarcation of the 14 districts as per the agro-climatic zones. These multiple contextual filters finally helped to identify Sonebhadra and Bahraich districts from Uttar Pradesh and Katihar and Samstipur districts from Bihar.
 After the identification of these districts, based on the highest production, the top two or three crops were selected from both cereals and horticulture. All districts were thus scored. Two top districts from each state were shortlisted. The final shortlisted districts included Katihar, Araria and Samastipur from Bihar whereas Siddharthnagar and Bahraich from Uttar Pradesh. The districts Araria and Samastipur had the same score and hence secondary research was further carried out in the context of connectivity, diversity of crops and available infrastructure.
 It was found that Samastipur district had more diversity in terms of crop production, better infrastructure and connectivity, thus demonstrating its capability for value creation. It was therefore decided to include Samastipur in the study. As mentioned above, in case of Uttar Pradesh, three districts were shortlisted. These districts were Siddharthnagar, Bahraich and Sonbhadra. However, after applying the criteria of representation of different agro-climatic zone, it was found that Siddarthnagar and Bahraich represented the same North-Eastern plain agro-climatic zone. Therefore, in order to have different agro-climatic zone represented, Sonbhadra district that falls in Bindhya zone was finalized.

 Sub category:Climate Change Impact Assessment, Value Chain Analysis, Stakeholder Engagement","Background, Introduction and Methodology"," > Developing research tools for stakeholders ,To understand the impact of climate change on small and marginal farmers, farmers were first asked to identify, the climate change impacts which they perceived had impact on select crops for this study with pre-structured-tested questionnaire. Capturing qualitative information to access quantitative impacts is a known challenge, more so when the impact varies from individual to individual. In order to address this problem, the research team designed a five-point scale to capture qualitative information under this study. The scale so designed was discussed with the farmers. They were asked to assign 1-5 numbers to the climate change impact based on the intensity of the impact. Accordingly, 1 was assigned to climate impacts where there was no loss of production, while score 2 meant noticeable loss in production due to climate change. Going up on the scale, a partial loss in production due to climate impact was assigned the number 3. The number 4 represents significant loss in productiondue to climate change and number 5 was assigned to complete loss of production due to climate change. Once the climate change impacts for different crops were identified then the research team discussed different types of adaptations, by small and marginal farmers. To understand the extent of adaptations, farmers rated key adaptations on the 5-point scale. For a calculation of value chain losses this study has focused on the losses due to climate change during the process of storage and processing. Losses incurred during transportation have been excluded for cereals and potato, as the losses incurred during the process were not observed to be directly linked with climate change. All stakeholders in the value chain were further interviewed with the structured questionnaire and, wherever possible, group discussions with representatives of each value chain were also conducted. To quantify the value chain losses, we have used production figures for the 36 districts from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar from the most vulnerable districts identified by NICRA. For the calculations of value chain losses, production numbers from area and production statistics maintained by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare13 were used. For estimating losses across the value chain, the average of the range quoted by stakeholders during personal interviews was used. The regulated value chain which involves procurement and distribution by government-nominated agencies/ Food Corporation of India (FCI) has been excluded while estimating losses. For estimating losses of produce, the MSP declared for year 2018-19 by the government was used. Information collected from farmers about primacy of crops was also cross-checked with agriculture traders, grain merchants, representatives of the district chambers of commerce from each district as well as government officials. District officials from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) (Agriculture Science Centres), initiated by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), were consulted to establish the validity of the collected information. Finally, the team visited wholesale agriculture mandis (trading centres) to validate the data collected for various crops and the level of value addition in the select value chains. Post this, all the key value agents -- right from farmers to processing units and finally the logistic agents of the identified value chains -- were interviewed with the help of the specifically structured questionnaire (see Annexure V) to understand the climate change impact and adaptation measures (see Annexure VI for the detailed methodology).","Understanding Climate Change

 Sub Category:Stakeholder Education, Value Chain Analysis, Attribution of Climate Change Impacts","Background, Introduction and Methodology","> One of the key challenges that we faced in this study was a lack of understanding among stakeholders regarding the differences between climate change and climate variability. Most stakeholders treat climatic variabilityas the only impact of climate change. Similar was lack of understanding with respect to adaptations among farmers. For farmers, it was difficult to differentiate between adoption of good practices to increase production adaptations to mitigate the impact of climate change. This lack of understanding was also evident in other value chain actors such as aggregators, traders, warehouse owners and processors. Stakeholders in the value chain, including farmers, treat adaptations in the same way as alterations, modifications or even adjustments which were even minor in nature in their value addition process. It was difficult to differentiate between losses due to inefficient value chain/production system. The other limitation was with respect to attributing the impacts faced by farmers and other stakeholders in the value chain entirely to the climate change. Most previous studies on the impact of climate change on agriculture were focused on production and productivity with no or limited focus on value chain participants and value chain losses.","Understanding Climate Change

UNDP,"Sub Title:Review of Literature
 Category:Analysis and Research Gap",Review of Literature," > The key findings of the literature review and case studies presented above can be summed up as:
 1. The available literature highlights the climate risks associated with various commodities as well as few actors of the value chain. The literature focuses on the climate risks such as increasing temperature, uneven rainfall, floods, drought, etc., and its impact on agriculture production systems;
 2. The literature also focuses on mitigation measures undertaken by farmers or companies/businesses at the production stage as most of the direct climate risks and exposure to vulnerability are more evident at the pre-harvest stage. The deterioration at this stage results in an indirect impact up the value chain;
 3. There have been a few studies which explain commodities such as maize, rice, wheat, etc., but fail to highlight the impact of climate change on different actors along the chain; and
 4. Available studies that have highlighted the impact on value chains and adaptive measures reveal that, in most cases, the measures are reactionary and undertaken in isolation by actors. Thus, they remain too unit specific and uncoordinated to be able to create risk mitigatio along the entire value chain. There are very few documented evidences of post- harvest adaptations in value chains. It is in this context that the present study Ã¢â‚¬Å“Understanding climate change adaptation for smallholders/marginal farmers and quantifying its impact on agri-allied value chains in Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP)Ã¢â‚¬Â is of significance in exploring the gaps identified in the studies reviewed above. The present study aims at focusing on the post- harvest adaptations to climate change as we move up the value chain. The review of the available literature shows that most studies, done so far, largely focused on the impact of climate change on agriculture with very little attention given to studying the impact of climate change on post-harvest value chain agents, their adaptations and adaptation costs. There are some studies that focused on the adaptation measures of some key post-harvest value agents but again the entire value chain focus was missing from these studies. This study, therefore, aims not only to understand the impact of climate change on the value chain of identified crops, climate adaptations by the actors but also tried to explore the effect of climate adaptations on actors across the value chain. Through this study, an attempt is being made to bring together various climate change-related issues which affect the agriculture value chains in IGP with specific focus on the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.","Understanding Climate Change

 Category:Climate Change Adaptation in Agricultural Value Chains
 Sub Category:Impacts on Value Chain Actors, Adaptation Strategies, Policy Response",Understanding Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture Value Chains," > Climate change is increasingly seen as a major threat to the food security and sustainability of agriculture. Its impact on agriculture could result in threatening the livelihoods of a large number of households who are dependent on agriculture and allied activities. Agricultural productivity is affected by climate change in two ways: first, directly, due to changes in temperature, precipitation and/or CO2 levels and, second, indirectly, through changes in soil, distribution and frequency of infestation by pests, insects, diseases or weeds. Climate change symptoms such as water deficit conditions combined with thermal stress could adversely affect important food crops like wheat and rice productivity. Climate change can affect crop yields and, in extreme case, the types of crops that can be grown in certain areas by impacting agricultural inputs such as water for irrigation, amounts of solar radiation as well as the prevalence of pests. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) examined the vulnerability of agricultural production to climate change, with the objective of determining differences in climate change impacts on agriculture by region and by crops. The study found that increases in temperature (by about 2oC) reduced potential grain yields in most places. Climate change is also predicted to lead to boundary changes in areas suitable for growing certain crops. Reductions in yields as a result of climate change are predicted to be more pronounced for rain-fed crops (as opposed to irrigated crops) and under limited water supply situations because there are no coping mechanisms for rainfall variability. In sub- tropical environments, the decrease in potential wheat yields ranged from 1.5 to 5.8 percent while in tropical areas the decrease was relatively higher, suggesting that warmer regions can expect greater crop losses. Overall, temperature increases are predicted to reduce rice yields. An increase of 2-4oC is predicted to result in a reduction in yields. Eastern regions are predicted to be most impacted by increased temperatures and decreased radiation, resulting in relatively fewer grains and shorter grain filling durations22.A value chain is simply defined as the path or system which adds value to the product or service offered. In the case of agri value chains, this path has different actors and varying value contribution happens at different levels. Value contribution is a function of the relationships between these actors, information sharing and use, and handling of processes efficiently. Growth and development of agricultural value chains is a powerful tool for economic empowerment particularly for small and marginal farmers. The analytical framework for this assignment treats the value chain as a sequence of value addition activities, from production of agriculture produce to making it fit for consumption in various forms, through activities such as transportation, storage and processing. Generally, value chain approaches focus on activities from production to final consumption but, for this study, we have limited the scope to the final processing only. Value chain actors such as wholesalers and retailers stated that, due to the nature of their business and the multiplicity of products in which they deal, it would be difficult to differentiate between supply chain inefficiency-related loss and climate change-related loss. For most commodities grown in IGP, increased focus is being observed in activities such as storage, processing and trading with a higher degree of coordination amongst farmers, warehouse/cold storage owners and processors in the value chain. Due to changes in consumption patterns, the demand for value-added food products is increasing.
 > Climate change impacts are not limited to farmers only. It affects the entire chain from producer to final consumer. Although the primary impact of climate change is on the very production and quality of the crop, the effects are faced by all value chain agents. Substantial value addition has been done by these value agents by the time the final produce reaches to the ultimate consumers. Climate change not only has a bearing on the quantity and quality of supplies of raw material that these post-harvest value chain agents receive, but also on the various value additions as well. In spite of this close correlation, the climate impact studies appear to have focused more on studying the pre-harvest impacts. In order to preserve their value-addition capabilities, value chain actors need to adapt to changing conditions by means of incremental changes to their production systems and use of resources. In extreme cases, it may even affect their business continuity by making the existing economic structures obsolete. Overall, these changes will affect economic opportunities, profitability and competitiveness, livelihoods, sources of growth and employment and socio-economic outcomes.
 >  Consideration of the effects of climate change on value chains is a relatively new, yet-to-be explored area of research with the majority of agricultural adaptation research focused on the impact of climate change on farming. Limited attention is given to the whole system that creates and delivers value (the value chain) and implications that climate change and the resulting actions have on other actors in a value chain. Climate change impacts value chains in many ways. It affects the quality and yield of agriculture commodities and, hence, in order to maintain the quality of final products value chain agents need to adapt by making changes into their supply chain and production systems which require additional resources. The change in climate sometimes adversely impacts production in their procurement areas and they need to make alternate arrangements for procurement, leading to higher procurement and transportation cost. Climate change can also have an impact on the quality of the final products as well the shelf life.Adopting a value chain perspective makes it possible not only to identify the direct effect of climate change on private sector/firms constraints and behaviour but also to consider an indirect effect of climate change through its impact on upstream (supply) and downstream (demand) sectors, as well as on transversal sectors such as infrastructure and logistics which are essential for value chain operations to take place. The impact of climate change is also leading to an increased tendency on the part of value chain agents to relax the quality norms for procuring paddy wheat from farmers due to their long-term relations and inter dependency. Changes in climatic conditions increase the cost of operations for warehouse/cold storage owners due to an increase in electricity charges, fumigation expenses and lower capacity utilization. The impact of climate change affects the small business more than the big business as small businesses lack resources for adequate planning and preparedness. The vulnerability of small businesses is also higher due to lack of financial resources to endure even a small rupture in the supply chain which may be caused, for instance, by an extreme weather event. As the flow of raw materials starts from the farmers end, the adverse impact at the farmer level affects all actors in the value chain. The adoption of short duration high yielding varieties (HYV) by farmers as an adaptation in monsoon crops affects the business of traders, warehouse owners, transporters as well the final processors. Similarly, an increase in moisture content of the raw material affects the conversion ratio during processing, increases the cost of production and leads to higher investments for the purchase of new equipment and machines. Climate change alters the capabilities of value chain participants, as the value created by value chain agents diminishes. These changes affect economic profitability, competitiveness, livelihoods and employment growth as well. Value chain actors, other than farmers, try to mitigate the risks of climate change by adopting various strategies which include procurement of produce from alternate sources, improvement of the supply chain, changes in processes, investment in plants and machineries, etc. Though adoption of these measures helps value chain actors in minimizing the operational risks, it increases their financial risks by raising the cost of production. They also face threats from competitors as barriers to entry are quite low in the agriculture value chain. The available literature presents a skewed information picture. It is mostly on the impact of climate change on agriculture. The studies have documented quantitative and qualitative impacts of climate change on agriculture. Based on the results and recommendation of these studies, there have been efforts by governments and civil societies to design the required policy response. However, as reported by the post-harvest value chain agents of the identified commodities from the IGP region, not much policy response is seen to develop the climate resilience capacity of the post-harvest value chain agents. Among other reasons, this could also be attributed to the absence of sufficient relevant studies leading to limited policy inputs on climate change impacts of the post-harvest value chain. Through this study, an attempt is being made to bring together various climate change-related issues which affect the post-harvest agriculture value chains in IGP with specific focus to states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.","Understanding Climate Change

 Category:Agricultural Sustainability in Rice Production
 Sub Category:Climate Change Impacts, Yield Improvement, Value Chain Integration","Climate Change Impacts on Paddy Cultivation, Paddy Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> The rice-based cropping system of the IGP region is one of the most important cropping patterns for food security. Apart from the food security, it also provides employment and livelihoods to millions of rural households. The crop is grown during the warm, sub-humid monsoon summer months with the cropping season starting from June and concluding around November-December. The crop is grown mostly in a rainfed-based ecosystem. Most small and marginal farmers grow rice for their household consumption and there is little marketable surplus. India's paddy production has shown an increase of over 150 percent. Yield improvement contributed 84 percent to this increase while area expansion contributed only 16 percent. Both production and productivity have increased since the early 1970s, after the introduction of HYV and their widespread adoption by farmers. In the rice production ecosystem, there has been significant improvement in total factor productivity which may be attributed to the development and large-scale adoption of newer varieties and vertical integration of value chain actors.
 The number of rainy days is constantly decreasing in most areas across IGP leading to increased intensity of rainfall whenever it rains. Furthermore, the incidence of weather extremes, duration and frequencies of drought and floods is becoming more frequent which may significantly impact the yields of rice in the region. IARI examined the vulnerability of agricultural production to climate change, with the objective of determining differences in climate change impacts on agriculture. Overall, temperature increases are predicted to reduce rice yields. An increase of 2-4oC of temperature is predicted to result in a significant reduction in yield of paddy. The same study also suggests that increased temperatures and decreased radiation will result in relatively fewer grains and shorter grain filling durations24 (Key sheet 6-Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture in India, Indian Agriculture Research Institute). At the producer level, nearly 75 percent of rice production is considered as marketable surplus. Of this 75 percent marketable surplus, between 40 to 50 percent is procured by FCI or the supporting state government agencies and the remaining is available for the private sector. In terms of consumption, 88-90 percent of the paddy grown in IGP states is consumed in the form of rice while 10 to 12 percent is used as other value-added products such as poha-chura (flattened rice) and murhi (puffed rice) with concentration of such units being higher in Bihar than in Uttar Pradesh.","Understanding Climate Change

 Sub Category :Paddy Cultivation, Production Challenges, Adaptation Measures","Climate Change Impacts on Paddy Cultivation, Paddy Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> The farmers group narrated three types of impacts of climate change on paddy cultivation. The first in terms of production and productivity; second, quality of produce; and, third, increased cost of production to minimize the impact of climate change. In extreme situation (flood/ severe drought), there is also risk of the complete loss of production.Paddy, a water dependent crop, is prone to extreme weather conditions. Excessive heat, humidity and erratic rainfall affects the growth of paddy and the incidences of pest infestation. An increase in temperature leads to reduction in crop growth duration, increase in pollen sterility, reduced seed set and number of grains, and reduced grain weight which cause yield reduction. Farmers reported that, in recent years, climatic conditions have been very unpredictable. Unexplainable delay in rains, insufficient and untimely rains resulting in excessive humidity and prolonged periods of high temperature are resulting in increased incidences of pest attacks on the paddy crop. Farmers have also reported that peak temperature is soaring high every year recently. They further communicated that, due to prolonged periods of heat, the moisture level in soil is decreasing as is the immunity level making the crops more susceptible to diseases. The key impacts perceived by farmers, intensity of the impacts and how they affects the paddy production ecosystem are discussed below.","Understanding Climate Change

UNDP,"Sub Title:Adaptation Measures
 Category:Climate Change Adaptation in Agriculture
 Sub category: Paddy Cultivation, Value Chain Classification, Adaptation Strategies","Climate Change Impacts on Paddy Cultivation, Paddy Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders"," > Climate change adaptation involves taking action to adjust to, or respond to, the effects of changes in climate. Adaptations to climate change exist at the various levels during the growth cycle of paddy. Types of adaptation ranges from change in variety, more application of inputs, change in planting and harvest dates, tillage and rotation practices, substitution of crop varieties, increased fertilizer or pesticide applications, and improved irrigation and drainage systems. Farmers reported that in recent years, their traditional wisdom, their predictions based on certain traditional pre- monsoon indicators have proved wrong and they are not always sure about planning their farm practices. The most important characteristics of climate change observed by farmers are disproportionate, short duration, untimely and delayed rains. To mitigate
 the effect of rainfall variations, farmers have started adaptations with nursery preparation in phased manners. Planting of HYV/hybrids and application of agro-chemicals is increasingly becoming a common pratice to mitigate the negative impact of changes in the monsoon. Due to delayed and insufficient rains, farmers using short duration and low water requirement types of seed varieties which not only affect the cost of production but also varietal diversity which was a unique characteristic rice cultivation. In addition to this, there has been adaptation of System of Rice Intensification (SRI) by farmers in IGP. This adaptation has largely been driven by the government and non-government organizations. Farmers as well the researchers stated that under changing climatic conditions, it helps them in optimizing water resources and reducing usage of insecticides/pesticides. Farmers also said that adaptation of SRI had helped them in increasing the rice yield over the traditional method of flooded rice cultivation. As the impacts of climate change perceived by farmers are non-uniform, adaptations by the small and marginal farmers have also been erratic. Typically, paddy transplantation happens after 20-25 days of nursery preparation. Farmers now prepare the nursery in phases as well as maintain additional stock of seedlings. This strategy helps them in minimizing the risks of delayed rainfall. We also came across cases where farmers are selling seedlings to other farmers who do not have seedlings available at the time of transplantations.Farmers undertake adaptation measures which help them in minimizing yield losses; nevertheless the quality of paddy is affected. The crop sometimes loses its natural shine and the weight of grain is affected. The frequency of un-ripe paddy is also on rise. The millers complain about the decreasing conversion rate of paddy to rice and thus offer either low rates or reduce the weight of the total paddy sold by 2-3 percent of the total weight supplied by the farmers. In case of paddy, the incidences of hollow or semi-hollow shells have been increasing. Farmers further said that, in recent years, seed companies have introduced short varieties with lower duration which has helped in mitigating the climate change impact to some extent. Farmers have observed that these new varieties are more prone to diseases and therefore they are constantly under pressure to match production by increasing the doses of inputs to maintain production and avoid incidences of pest attack.The effect of climate change on value chain participants is of two types. The first one is related to the quality of paddy received at various levels of the value chain and second is with respect to receiving an adequate amount of paddy so that production facilities can run at optimal level. These issues become important as the cost of mitigations by various value chain participants involves extra cost either in the form of capital investment or increased cost of operations. At the producer level, nearly 75 percent of rice production is considered as marketable surplus. Of this 75 percent marketable surplus, between 45 to 50 percent is procured by FCI or supporting state government agencies and the remaining is available for the private sector. Based on the geographical distance between the producer and end consumer and the number of intermediaries involved in the process between them, we have tried to classify the value chain of paddy under four categories. The impact of climate change depends upon the type of value chain. Traditional rice value chain: This value chain consists of the local supply chain of paddy grown by the farmer which is de-husked in a local village mill and consumed by farmer households; the remaining is sold in the local village market for local consumption. In this value chain, the impact of climate change is mostly borne by the end consumer. This value chain is affected due to inferior quality of paddy which often leads to a high percentage of broken rice and impurities. The impact is minimized as broken rice also is consumed either in the form of broken rice or in the form of rice flour. No tangible value chain losses happen on paddy processed through this value chain.Transitional rice value chain (intra-state/inter- district trade): The transitional rice value chain is one of the most prevalent value chains in IGP after the regulated value chain. Farmers sell paddy to village- based aggregators who then sell it to urban markets from where it is procured by rice millers. Millers also have agents who purchase directly from the farmers or through village-based aggregators. They generally procure in the initial months after harvesting and store it on their premises. Rice millers sell the rice to the city-based whole sellers from where it reaches the consumers through retailers.These rice millers generally operate and function at the state level with most of the trade happening at inter- district/intra-state level. During storage at mills, losses for rice range between 4 and 5 percent which happens due to quality standards not met during procurement and moisture losses. Rice millers observed that earlier this percentage used to be around 2 to 3 percent. As they have regular suppliers with whom they maintain long-term relationships, it becomes difficult for them to return the produce.In recent years, most mill owners have adopted rubber roll shellers which have reduced the percentage of broken rice. Another adaptation strategy is to shift to parboiling as the rice becomes harder and results in higher milling yield with lesser breakage and more oil content in the bran. However, it requires additional capital and an increase in operating costs due to higher energy consumption Long Value Chains (Inter-State Trade): This value chain has a large number of intermediaries/actors. Due to the significant time lag between the production of paddy and consumption of the product,it faces the highest risks of climate change impacts. Generally, rice millers with large capacity operate in this value chain. They operate throughout the year and have continuous procurement. They store bulk paddy in private warehouses. Climate change impact occurs both due to quality-related issues as well due to fluctuation of the preferred price. The colour of rice is affected if there is rain at the time of harvesting and the paddy has not been dried properlySometimes due to adverse climatic conditions at the time of grain filling, the brittleness of the paddy increases which leads to more breakage of rice. The impact of quality-related challenges is highest for such millers as they must meet quality standards.Regulated Value Chain
 This value chain accounts for the maximum percentage of rice produced in the IGP states, particularly in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Under this arrangement, milled rice is manufactured by milling paddy procured by the state governments/agencies and FCI. Paddy is procured by agencies nominated by the state government. Paddy procured thus is then supplied to rice millers who, in turn, deliver it back to the nominated agencies of FCI. This value chain is not impacted much due to liberal quality standards. This value chain faces a moderate level of impact of climate change as quality norms are relaxed, both at the time of procurement as well as during supply of rice. Millers observed that they were finding it difficult to meet the conversion percentage fixed by FCI authorized agencies.","Understanding Climate Change

UNDP,"Sub Title:Impact of Climate Change on Commercial Warehousing
 Category:Agricultural Supply Chain Management
 Sub category:Storage and Warehousing Practices for Paddy Crop","Climate Change Impacts on Paddy Cultivation, Paddy Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> It was observed that both large traders and millers procure paddy from various sources after harvest and store it for three or four months. A gap of a minimum of 1 metre is left between and around the stacks with a 1.5 metre clearance between the top of the stack and roof. Arrival of paddy starts from December onwards and the average storage period is around three to four months. One impact is that during storage at the warehouse, the moisture level needs to be constantly maintained below 14 percent and proper safeguards undertaken to ensure that it does not imbibe moisture from the surrounding air. The other impact is higher fumigation costs. Increased temperature and humidity are favourable for storage insects/pests which can multiply faster in such conditions. To maintain quality, grains stacked in gunny bags needs to be periodically fumigated. In such circumstances warehouses need more cycles of fumigation which results in increased cost of warehouse maintenance. Though it cannot entirely be attributed to climate change but expansion of commercial warehousing has led to the creation of additional warehouse space. Due to the loss of varietal diversity of paddy crops, almost all farmers grow the same variety which is harvested at the same time. In case of warehouses where farmers themselves store the paddy, the duration becomes shorter while traders  warehouses face tough competition in getting paddy to fully utilize the space.","Understanding Climate Change

 Category:Rice Milling and Processing
 Sub Category:Impact of Climate Change on Milling Practices and Quality Standards","Climate Change Impacts on Paddy Cultivation, Paddy Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> All participants in the paddy value chain are completely dependent on the supply of raw material. Millers get their raw material (paddy) from different channels such as farmers, traders and FCI authorized centres. Rice mills that have an agreement with FCI for processing of paddy and supplying rice to FCI again, get paddy from FCI. However, they do mill for private traders as well. For millers who do not have such an agreement with FCI get around 20-25 percent of their total requirement of paddy from farmers while traders from the local mandis supply th rest (75-80 percent) of the total requirement. Most rice millers pointed out that high adoption of short duration hybrid rice has had an adverse effect on the milling of rice. They also stated that long duration paddy has more flowering days during the crop cycle which increases both the yield and quality of rice.
 > Rice millers define good quality as paddy that has:Low moisture levels , Minimum percentage of foreign materials and Small percentage of empty shells, etc.
 > Prolonged periods of high temperature are considered an important manifestation of climate change. Millers observed that high temperature impacts the paddy crop during the ripening stage in the following ways: Decrease in grain weight , Reduced grain filling and Higher percentage of white chalky and milky white rice.
 > Regular increases in temperature and prolonged periods of drought-like situations in the midst of the rainy season affect the moisture content in the paddy which leads to a higher percentage of broken rice. Millers reported that, in recent years, the percentage of broken rice has increased by 2 to 3 percent. They also pointed out that short duration paddy has lower conversion rates to the extent of 1 to 2 percent than the traditional variety. The short duration variety paddy is relatively more brittle, so the percentage of broken rice is high. Millers associated with FCI pointed out that the existing fixed conversion rate (67 percent) is not possible with these new varieties. Millers who have arrangements with FCI/ State Food Corporations for custom rice milling are still in the business due to relatively easier quality control norms, benefits of by-products and lower requirement of working capital. Rice millers foresee a shift towards rice parboiling, as it helps in eliminating chalkiness in milled rice grains. The process of steaming and drying reduces grain breakage during the milling process and increases
 grain translucency. It also increases grain hardness and manages to reduce grain breakage as a result of the swelling of the starchy endosperm during gelatinizing. Millers reported that, though this process is effective in minimizing broken rice, shifting to steam-based plants is expensive and small and medium entrepreneurs cannot always afford the cost of technology upgradation as well. Another adaption has been in terms of a shift to rubber roll sheller as this leads to a smaller percentage of rice breakage. Millers in Bihar have observed a high incidence of impurities in supplies of the paddy which they procure from outside the state. Millers have also reported that a proportion of under-ripe paddy has increased and is now 1 to 2 percentage of the total paddy that they receive. Millers also said that incidences of indrajou (a kind of weed) have increased in recent times. To mitigate the impact of this, mill owners have to incur additional labour charges in cleaning or invest in cleaning machinery.
 > Millers think that they have limited control over the situation but increased competition is forcing them to accept inferior quality of paddy in the process. Consequently, millers are investing in graders and sorters with high configurations as well as pre-cleaners. This amounts to an additional investment of around INR 5 million to 10 million per mill for a commercial large-sized mill. Of late, millers are also thinking of entering into contracts with paddy farmers where farmers can be supplied with the right inputs, training and weather information in lieu of an assured supply of quality paddy.","Understanding Climate Change

 Category:Food Processing and Value Addition
 Sub Category:Impact of Climate Change on Puffed Rice Manufacturing","Climate Change Impacts on Paddy Cultivation, Paddy Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> Puffed rice (murmura/murhi) and rice flakes or flattened rice (poha) are an important value addition in the paddy value chain. Puffed rice is a product made from rice, which is lightweight crisp and ready to eat. As the name suggests, puffed rice is made by a process involving
 high pressure heating of the grains. Traditionally, the production of puffed rice in India was largely limited to the village level but now it has gradually emerged as a mechanized industry. The puffing method traditionally followed in India is sand-roasting. Getting good quality of rice is of utmost importance to puffed rice processing units. For the preparation of puffed rice, some units procure paddy directly from the farmers while some unit owners procure and process parboiled rice to obtain puffed rice. In units where parboiled rice is the raw material, rice is gently heated on the furnace without sand to reduce the moisture content slightly. It is then mixed with a salt solution and again roasted on the furnace in small batches with sand on a strong fire for a few seconds to produce the expanded rice. These processors face a limited impact of climate change on the quality of raw material except for the rise in prices when the supply reduces due to low production of paddy. They face some problems in maintaining the crispiness of puffed rice if there are prolonged periods of rains. Processors reported that, in recent years, due to changing climate conditions, incidences of high moisture, higher percentage of broken and black rice and greater percentage of impurities in the rice are on the rise, affecting the quality and cost of the processing. This leads to 2 to 3 percent of loss of the finished product leading to a production loss of INR 90-100 per quintal of puffed rice produced. Due to the high moisture content in the raw material, processors have to invest in drying the rice, resulting in use of extra driers and an additional cost of INR 10 per quintal. However, as suggested by the representative of one of the largest units, drying rice in natural light is a must to ensure better quality of puffed rice. However, in recent years, since the rains have become unpredictable, processors have to be more vigilant while drying paddy in sunlight. Many mills have also invested in blowers costing about INR 200,000 to remove impurities from the paddy. Other processors of puffed rice are also facing the same problem due to the diminishing quality of paddy and are adapting by increasing investment in relevant machinery such as dryers and blowers.","Understanding Climate Change

UNDP,Sub Title:Climate Change Impact on Beaten Rice/Flattened Rice,"Climate Change Impacts on Paddy Cultivation, Paddy Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> Flattened rice is another important value chain agent in the paddy value chain. Traditionally, it is prepared from soaked paddy, after heat treatment and immediate flattening using a flaking machine (an edge runner). Paddy is soaked in water for two or three days to soften the kernel followed by boiling in water for a few minutes and draining the water off. The paddy is heated in a shallow earthen vessel or sand in an iron pan till the husks break open. It is pounded by a wooden pestle which flattens the kernel and removes the husk. The husk is separated b winnowing. Flaked rice is thin and papery and of white colour. Processors of flattened rice complained about the higher percentage of broken rice and of low-quality paddy post paddy processing and of low-quality paddy. For the flattened rice industry, a whole and healthy grain
 of paddy is important so as to make good flaked rice. However, processors have been unable to get good quality supplies of late. Even the percentage of empty shells is higher by 2-3 percent. The firms are constantly identifying newer geographies for raw material supply. However, this increases the transportation cost leading to an increase of 1-2 percentage of the procurement price. Processors reported that earlier they would keep the stock for two or three days only as the supply was regular; however, in recent years, there is stiff competition among the traders and millers to get good quality of paddy and many firms now maintain eight to10 days of stock. As a result, interest cost has increased. Processors also mentioned that labour costs in cleaning and transportation have increased. Firms have also reported that they have had to invest INR 200,000 to 250,000 in purchasing sievers to minimize the impurities","Understanding Climate Change

 Sub Category:Solvent Extraction and Cattle Feed Production","Climate Change Impacts on Paddy Cultivation, Paddy Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> Rice bran is the most valuable by-product in the paddy value chain. Rice bran contains about 18-20 percent rice bran oil which is the raw material for the solvent extraction unit. In the solvent extraction facility, rice bran oil is extracted as the chief product; de-oiled rice bran (DORB) is the by-product, a rich source of protein and used as a chief ingredient in cattle feed preparation. Solvent plants collect this rice bran from rice millers and after due process produce crude rice bran oil.On an average, 20 percent is the extraction rate for the rice bran industry. These industries are primarily concentrated around rice producing geographies. Due to the very nature of this supply arrangement, solvent plants procure their raw material from multiple local rice millers as well as those from outside. Extractability of oil depends on a good milling process and supply of rice bran which should be ideally within four to six days after its recovery from the milling process. Solvent extraction plants check for the extractability percentage before accepting the bran lot. Other than supply-related issues due to fluctuating production, no climate change impact was observed on solvent plants.","Understanding Climate Change

 Category:Agricultural Economy
 Sub Category: Crop Diversification and Market Dynamics","Climate Change Impacts on Maize Cultivation, Maize Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> Maize is an important crop after wheat and rice in IGP. In Uttar Pradesh, maize is grown primarily in the kharif (monsoon) season while in Biha  it is grown in both rabi (winter) and kharif (monsoon). In comparison to other competing cereals, maize, due to its photo- insensitive nature has wider adaptability and hence can be grown in all cropping seasons. Kharif or early summer season maize is short duration while rabi season maize is of a little longer duration. Rabi maize is also considered to have superior transpiration efficiency, lower usage of water per unit of production and high versatile usage which makes it easily marketable. The proportion of cropped areas under rabi maiz  is increasing in Bihar. The development of different varieties of seeds with varying maturity period also makes it an attractive crop for cultivators. Both the area and the production of maize are increasing especially in the central IGP. Average grain yield during kharif season varies between 2 to 2.5 MT per ha while in rabi it is more than 4 MT per ha. Favourable agro-climatic conditions, low infestation of insects, pests and diseases, slow growth of weeds and almost no risks from extreme events such as floods or droughts makes maize an attractive crop in the rabi season. Cultivation of maize is also less resource (water, fertilizer, etc.) intensive, when compared to paddy or wheat in IGP. Even though the growth in crop area in the last 20 years has been limited, there has been significant increase in production due to an increase in productivity. The arrival of rabi maize produced in Bihar starts in April and continues till June, depending on the duration of winter. The kharif maize is grown between the months of June to October and arrives in the market from late October to early December. Around 85-90 percent of the maize produced in both Bihar and Uttar Pradesh is marketable surplus. Due to its wide usage, maize has a very long value chain. In general, maize is known to have around 67-72 percent of starch, 12-15 percent of moisture, 8-12 percent of protein, 2-4 percent of fat, 2-3 percent of fibre and around 1.5 percent minerals. Most maize produced in India is used in the poultry feed industry. The poultry industry is heavily dependent on maize as it covers 50 to 60 percent of the input required for broiler feed and around 25-35 percent of the input required for layer eed. Maize is preferred by the poultry value chain against other substitutes due to its easy availability, higher energy content and price economics. Around 14-15 percent of the total maize produced goes into the cattle feed industry and another 10-15 percent into the starch industry where it is processed further to produce key ingredients for the confectionery, toothpaste and pharmaceutical industries. The recovery of starch
 from maize is around 60-65 per cent. Due to the wide commercial usage of starch produced from maize,the starch value chain share is showing continuous increase. Since weather conditions are favourable for winter maize, it has started showing signs of gradually replacing wheat in some districts of Bihar. Farmers who don't have their own irrigation facilities prefer to grow maize rather than wheat.Adverse climatic conditions affect the quantity and quality of maize and have a cascading effect on the entire value chain albeit with varying degrees. Most value chain agents use maize grain rather than some of its by-products. This peculiarity of the maize value chain makes it susceptible to any adverse climatic impact on quantity and quality of maize production.","Understanding Climate Change

 Sub category :Wheat Production and Climate Resilience in India","Climate Change Impacts on Wheat Cultivation, Wheat Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> Wheat is the second most important crop in IGP. Apart from its importance in food security, it also provides employment and livelihoods to millions of rural households. The sowing of the crop starts in November and the crop is harvested by the early April. Production of wheat in India during 2016-17 was estimated to be around 98.38 MMT in the crop area of 30.6 million ha with an average productivity of 3.2 MT per ha. Wheat cultivation in IGP is irrigation dependent and farmers who have irrigated land grow wheat for self- consumption and marketabl surplus. The series of interventions during the period of the Green Revolution has transformed the production of wheat in the country. The transformation, particularly in IGP, has been phenomenal due to the acceptance of high-yielding varieties and adoption of other modern agricultural practices. Because of favourable climatic conditions, most of the major wheat growing states in India are located within IGP, including states such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab Haryana, Bihar, etc. The region provides favourable conditions with cool and moist weather during the winter which facilitates the growth ofthe plant and dry and warm weather from late February onwards that enables the grain to ripen properly. During the cropping season, this area provides the ideal germination temperature for wheat. The soil type of this region is also conducive for wheat cultivation. The other advantage of wheat cultivation is that, unlike rice, chances of complete failure of wheat crop in IGP are minimal. In IGP, the coping mechanism for climatic variability and rainfall variability is higher for wheat than the rice crop. Wheat cultivation starts under retreating monsoon conditions. Farmers apply two to three rounds of irrigations, followed by application of fertilizer. It is expected that climate change will lead to a rise in the maximum temperatures in winter as well as a reduction in the number of day with low temperatures. This may affect the wheat grown especially in middle part of IGP. As wheat uses the residual moisture in the field from paddy cultivation, a good monsoon also leads to better growth and yield in the wheat crop.","Understanding Climate Change

 Sub category:Wheat Cultivation and Climate Resilience in India","Climate Change Impacts on Wheat Cultivation, Wheat Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> Wheat grows well in cooler temperatures, with sowing in early winter and harvesting at the beginning of the summer. Temperature is a major factor which influences the yield. As wheat is grown as a winter-irrigated crop, the influence of rainfall is insignificant on the yield but any rains at the time of harvesting can do serious damage to the wheat crop. Farmers pointed out that if the rain falls between 20 to 75 days after sowing, it helps the crops and saves irrigation costs. Variations in wheat yield in IGP also depend on sowing dates, soil moisture, etc. Amongst these, wheat is most sensitive to high temperatures, especially during the reproductive stage as it increases the levels of water stress in the plant cell. Temperatures rising towards the end of its growth, especially during the grain-filling stage of development (early arrival of summer), affect the yield of wheat. Farmers were of the opinion that increased temperature in winters is a climate changes trend that they have witnessed lately. They said that, in recent years, temperature is relatively higher in the months of November and December than it used to be earlier. Farmers are adapting to this by sowing late, but this increases the risk of more than adequate heat exposure at the time of harvesting. Wheat is a thermo-sensitive crop and both its growth and productivity depend on the temperature during the cropping phase.
 Late sown wheat exposes pre-anthesis phenological events to high temperature which influence grain development and ultimately the yield. Farmers stated that if the temperature range deviates from the normal during flowering phases, it may affect the productivity of wheat. They also said that rainfall or cloudy weather may lead to a rust attack in the wheat crop. Higher temperature at the time of maturity also leads to forced maturity resulting in yield loss. Farmers also mentioned that, during the ripening season, the fear of rains or unfavourable conditions forces them to opt for harvesting, even when the crop grains have not fully matured. This early harvesting leads to low recovery of grain, with a higher proportion of immature seeds or broken and poor quality grains. Such grains are more susceptible to disease durin storage.","Understanding Climate Change

 Types of adaptation in wheat range from usage of newer seeds, more application of inputs, change in planting and harvest dates, increased fertilizer or pesticide applications, etc. One of most common adaptation at the farmer level is experimenting with sowing dates to minimize the effect of temperature or residual moisture. Farmers also shared that the frequency of seed replacement has also increased. If sowing is delayed due to climatic variations, farmers also increase the seed rate by reducing the spacing between plants.
 Usage of better-quality seeds, application of agro- chemicals and increased usage of fertilizer is helping farmers to mitigate the risks of climate change to a certain level. Increased mechanization during the harvesting period has been one of the greatest adaptation strategies by farmers. Apart from being used to overcome labour shortage, combine harvesters are also increasingly used to reduce climatic risks by shortening the harvesting window after ripening of the wheat. Though it is helping farmers to reduce the exposure of crops, it is also leading to events such as residual burning which is a contributor to adverse climatic conditions.","Understanding Climate Change

 Suv Category:Climate Resilience in Wheat Value Chains","Climate Change Impacts on Wheat Cultivation, Wheat Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders"," > Most stakeholders reported that overall growing conditions have been favourable for wheat in 2019. The extended winter conditions also helped to harvest a better yield. Even the government's preliminary estimate (Second Advance Estimate of 28 February 2019) for the year expected a production of around 99.1 MMT. The value chain participants confirmed that they had more production in 2019. FCI, along with the state agencies, procured more than 35 MMT of wheat in the 2018-19 marketing year (April-March) on the back of a bumper crop. Around 30 to 35 percent of the wheat produced by the farmers is used for self-consumption; around 5 percent is stored for seed while the remaining produce is marketable surplus. Sudden rains, hailstorms or heavy winds sometimes destroy or damage the wheat crop so much that such a crop is used for animal feed only. Beside this, the by-product from wheat milling (wheat bran-chokar) is also used for cattle feed. Three types of value chains exist for the wheat crop. The first is the regulated value chain which mainly covers wheat procured by FCI/nominated agencies and supplied back for distribution under the Public Distribution System (PDS). The second is the organized value chain which caters to the organized roller flourmills and flourmills. The third is an unorganized value chain that caters mainly to direct customers and small traders. This has wider reach and, in terms of the volume of wheat handled, this is the largest value chain among wheat value chains.
 > More than 75 percent of the remaining wheat is consumed in the form of flour (atta) while the rest is processed in roller flourmills that process around 13-14 MMT of wheat to produce various products such as maida, suji/rava/semolina and other bakery flours. Processing of flour (atta) is mainly done in the chakki (grinding stone) mills. In terms of the value chain, the value chain for roller flourmills is more organized while, barring few large players, the value chain for atta is largely unorganized.
 > Regulated Value Chain
 > FCI procures wheat on behalf of the Government of India from farmers through state-level cooperatives and/or nominated agencies. This procurement takes place at a pre-declared price under MSP. Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are the major contributors of wheat to the government procurement system. The data for the last few years also suggest that more than 30 percent of the wheat produced is procured by government agencies, especially in Uttar Pradesh.The wheat procured through FCI/nominated agencies is allocated to various state governments for distribution through PDS at a subsidized price. In years of enough surplus procurement and stocks, the government also sells wheat in the open market to the private trade to stabilize OMSS. The wheat distributed through this system is consumed in the form of flour (atta) and is processed through unorganized flourmills. The impact of climate change is not significant on this value chain due to non-stringent quality norms, at the time of procurement, distribution and processing. Whatever the impact of climate change, it is largely borne by the end consumer.
 > Organized Value Chain (Roller Flourmills/Flourmills)
 In this value chain, wheat is procured by organized private millers either directly or through agents from farmers as well from mandis. In Bihar, wheat trading is largely driven through private traders where traders supply wheat to roller flourmills. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers also directly supply to wheat mills. This value chain caters largely to large units of roller mills. The organized roller flourmill is an old value chain while the organized flourmill is new and is undergoing transformation. Wheat is used by roller flourmills with a conversion rate of around 97 percent. In this process, 60 to 65 percent of the final product is fine flour (maida), 20 to 25 percent is semolina (rawa-suji), 7-8 percent is residual flour and the remaining is recovered as bran which is used as/in cattle feed. The flour produced through this process is finer in compare to chakki flour. The end customers of this refined flour are restaurants and hotels who use it to make various items. Most of these roller mills have capacities varying between 20 to 50 MT per day and operate at 60-70 percent of their capacity.Organized flourmills are in the business of branded flour. These flourmills grind and sell wheat flour under their own brand name. Many such units also do contract grinding where they process for branded flour manufacturers. Wheat is supplied by the companies to the miller which is milled into whole flour (atta) as per the specified quality norms fixed by the companies. This value chain is highly impacted by climate change. The millers have to maintain high quality of the final produce and therefore any climate-affected impurities in wheat have to be cleared before processing. The millers are able to command 20-30 higher prices due to their higher quality/branding over unorganized players. This also works as the main incentive for these millers to invest in high-end machinery such as dryers and sorters to mitigate the climate change impact and stay ahead in the business.
 > Unorganized Value Chain, Wheat flour is the form in which wheat is largely consumed in India. This value chain consists of famers, small aggregators and small millers. Most of these mills do custom milling for farmers/small traders or consumers who procure wheat from farmers or small aggregators. Production of flour from wheat is done by milling with grinding stone (chakki). This technology is still used due to the unique aroma and texture of the flour which is preferred for household consumption. These chakki mills are generally small units with a processing capacity starting from 2 to 3 quintal per hour. The impact of climate change on this value chain is lower as its participants rarely engage in activities such as storage and branding. The only impact of climate change is on the increased cost of milling due to use of additional labour in manual cleaning and washing of wheat.","Understanding Climate Change

 Sub Category:Grain Storage Techniques and Quality Preservation","Climate Change Impacts on Wheat Cultivation, Wheat Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders"," > The arrival of wheat in both Bihar and Uttar Pradesh starts in the month of April and it continues till early June. The primary aim of storage activity is to prevent deterioration of the quality of grain. This is done through control of moisture and aeration and by saving the wheat grain from attack from microorganisms, insects and rodents. The practice of storage has also increased due to the facility of availing credits based on warehouse receipts.
 > Generally, wheat is stored for four to six months by farmers, in anticipation that it may lead to higher price realization. At the time of harvesting, grain normally contains 20 percent moisture. For safe storage, maintenance of around 12-14 percent grain moisture content is recommended. An increase in moisture may lead to musty odour, discoloration and lower flour yield. It is therefore necessary that an equilibrium moisture content for wheat around 13 at 70 percent relative humidity is maintained during storage. The storage of wheat starts in early summer and it continues till the rainy season. During this storage period, both temperature and humidity increase which is favourable for the growth of storage insect pests. In a hot and humid climate, they can multiply faster. Sometimes due to an early harvest, wheat grains have higher moisture content which increases the risks of quality deterioration. To maintain quality, grains stacked in gunny bags need to be periodically fumigated; warehouses therefore need to apply more cycles of fumigation which results in increased cost of storage.","Understanding Climate Change

To mitigate the quality-related impact of climate change, traders and millers are adopting stringent quality parameters at the time of procurement. Most millers have now invested in developing inbuilt facilities for drying (both sun/machine) of wheat. Large roller mills/ flourmills are now impacted by climate change due to increased cost of drying or rejections of wheat at the time of milling due to inferior quality or presence of foreign matters in the wheat.
 > Wheat with low moisture content, high on shining, heavy and uniform grain and low impurities are considered as good raw material. However, in recent years, due to increased humidity, the moisture level is increasing in wheat. Millers attribute the formation of small wheat grain (muniyadana) to climate change. Due to their small size, wheat grains get mixed with filtered impurities. Millers suffer production losses of around 2-3 percent due to this. Similarly, early onset of summer also affects the quality of wheat grain. This effect is magnified at the grain filling stage which leads to reduced grain size. Untimely rain before/at time of the harvest results in discoloured wheat. Recent experience of untimely rain during harvest months compelled farmers to harvest crop produce before maturity in haste. Millers observed that suc incidences increase the impurities by 1-1.5 percent. Millers reported that wheat with higher moisture content tended to consume more energy during processing. Although it is difficult to quantify an exact correlation, a pattern of higher energy consumption is being observed. Millers stated that use of drying units was not very common earlier. Now as they have started using them, electricity consumption has gone up by roughly 10-15 percent. Roller millers stated that the extraction proportion for different products such as maida/sooji also depends upon the moisture content of wheat. The quality of maida is affected by high moisture content in wheat. The cost of processing has increased to match the quality requirement due to investment in advanced machineries such as sievers, grinders and driers. Over 80 percent of these losses can be directly attributed at the stage of organized roller flourmills while the rest occur at the level of unorganized roller flourmills. Like other value chains studied, most post-production losses are directly attributable to higher operations costs due to adherence to qualit parameters because of the adverse impacts of climate change on the quality of the yield. Over the next decade, climate change variations can have a significant impact on the quality as well as productivity increasing overheads at the processing stage.","Understanding Climate Change

India is the secon  largest producer of potato after China. Major potato growing states in India are Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Bihar and Assam. The Indian potato belt stretches from Punjab (North West) to West Bengal in East India. Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Punjab together account for about 86 percent of IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potato production. Uttar Pradesh is the largest producer of potatoes in India.
 > Potato is usually sown in October-November and becomes ready to harvest by February-March. To take advantage of the high price, enterprising farmers also grow it a little earlier to get the crop ready even a month earlier than the regular schedule. Potato is a cool season crop and tolerates frost moderately. The ideal temperature for its growth during the initial stage is around 25C. Deep, well-drained and friable soils having good organic matter are ideal for its cultivation. In India, more than 80 percent of the potato crop is grown in the winter season (rabi) under irrigation during the short duration from October to March. The rainy season (kharif) potato production takes place in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttaranchal.

The potato plant has mainly two different growth stages. The first stage includes sprout development and plant establishment while the second stage is the phase of tuber development and maturing. Plant growth in both these phases is dependent upon environmental factors, such as temperature, soil, moisture availability and geographic location. Any climatic variation during these stages has the significant potential of creating a negative impact on the production or cost of production.
 > Potato is best adapted to cool climates with temperatures in the range of 15 to 250C. Temperature higher than this range retards tuberization. Additionally, heat stress also leads to a higher proportion of smaller tubers with paler skin colour of tubers. Temperature above 25-300C shortens the growing period of potatoes and reduces tuber yield.
 > During the winter, longer than usual periods of frost and dew cause the foliage to remain wet for prolonged periods during the day; this also affects the crop growth. The crop is also sensitive to water and yield is reduced in drought as well as in waterlogged conditions. Drought events occurring early in the growing season reduce the number of tubers per plant and even a single, short-term drought during tuber bulking decreases potato quality (i.e., tuber size and appearance) along with the overall yield.
 > Unseasonal rains around harvest lead to high soil moisture conditions which result in the crop rotting, making produce extremely vulnerable to disease/pest infestation even after harvesting.

 Sub Category:Potato Cultivation, Processing, and Distribution Strategies","Climate Change Impacts on Potato Cultivation, Potato Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders"," > Potato is considered a staple crop and is used in three ways: 60 to 65 percent is utilized as a vegetable for domestic table consumption while another 18 to 20 percent is retained as seed. Roughly 8 to 10 percent of the produce is used for higher value-added potato products. Amongst the various value-added products, potato chips account for approximately 60 percent of the processed potato products. Other processed potato products are potato flakes, alu bhujia, etc.
 > Potato processing is split into organized and unorganized sectors. The organized sector is under the control of large manufacturers with a presence across the country while the unorganized sector comprises small manufacturers with lesser-known or no brand names operating at the regional level. Potato chips are the most common product across both sectors. The processing industry in the IGP region is restricted to unorganized sectors with small players. The suitability of the variety grown in both Bihar and Uttar Pradesh is the key hindrance in the development of large potato processing units. Additionally, the accumulation of reducing sugar in high amounts during the cold storage process makes the potato unsuitable for processing. This affects both the taste and appearance of the final product. During the storage process, high usage of the sprout suppressant, CIPC, also limits the scope of its usage in processing. The varieties grown in these areas also have lower dry matter content.
 > Channel I: Producer - commission agent/wholesaler - retailer - consumer This is the most prevalent value chain adopted by potato growers, especially by small and marginal farmers. Volume wise, this value chain accounts for about 10 percent of the potato produced. Farmers after keeping aside some part for self-consumption (for three to four months) sell the remaining potato immediately. Rotting of potato starts very soon due to hot temperature. As small farmers lack the volume to take care of transportation and storage cost associated with col storage, they prefer to sell it immediately at the prevalent market prices. Even traders/wholesalers sell as early as possible in nearby urban mandis; the produce is purchased by end users through retailers. In this channel, 3 to 5 percent of losses happen due to rotting of potato. The losses are spread out across all value chain participants in the process with an aggregate loss of 3 to 5 percent in the process.
 > Channel II: Producer - cold storage - commission agent/ wholesaler - retailer - consumer This value chain accounts for the maximum percentage of potato produced in the region. Farmers belonging to medium and large category participate in this value chain which accounts for about 25 to 30 percent of the total potato grown in the area. They generally deliver potato in 50 kg bags in March and April to cold storage warehouses; this is taken out from September onwards. The rate for storage is independent of the period of storage. Generally, farmers must pay between INR 200 to 300 per quintal for storage for six months. This value chain is impacted by climate change the most. Cold storage owners reported that their cost had risen due to increased power consumption (electricity and diesel charges), spray of chemical to dela sprouting, sorting and repackaging of potato, etc. Overall this increases the cost of operation and maintenance by approximately 10 to 15 percent. The remaining value chain losses are borne by farmers. At the time of taking potato out of the cold storage, 3 kg of potato is deducte as shrinkage/ weight loss which happens during the period of storage. Farmers also store potato which is used as seed in the next cropping season.
 > Channel III: Producer - commission agent/wholesale - cold storage - wholesaler - retailer - consumer
 > This value chain also accounts for a significant proportion of potato produced in this region. The share of this value chain is constantly increasing. The only difference with the previous value chain is that, in this value chain, traders store the potato after purchasing from farmers aggregators at the time of harvesting. This value chain accounts for about 15 to 20 percent of the potato grown in the area. Traders begin storage in 50 kg bags in March and April and start taking the potato out according to the price movement in the market. Rates are fixe betwee INR 200 to 300 per quintal and are independent of the storage duration. This value chain is also impacted significantly due to climate change in the form of higher storage charges for traders and higher operational cost for cold storage owners.

Adequate and unrestricted air movement is also necessary to maintain constant temperature and humidity throughout the storage pile, and to prevent excessive shrinkage from moisture loss and decay.

 > The impact of climate change on cold storage occurs on two ways: electricity charges due to high rise in temperature; and humidity management. A longer summer season and delayed monsoons also affect the operations of cold storages by increasing the operational costs of running as they require larger amounts of electricity to maintain the optimal levels of temperature and humidity in the cold stores. As reported by cold storage owners, their electricity consumption units have increased by about 10-12 percent in the last few years. This amounts to INR 75 to 100 per MT.
 > Cold storages also face challenges related to capacity utilization, but this happens mainly due to fluctuation in production. The design of cold storage is such that it is only conducive for long-term storage of potato; they also store vegetables such as carrot for short durations.","Understanding Climate Change

 Category:Agriculture and Climate Change
 Sub category:Crop Cultivation and Market Dynamics","Climate Change Impacts on Tomato Cultivation, Tomato Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders"," > Tomato is the second most grown vegetable in the districts of IGP after potato. It is grown as a winter as well as a summer crop. The harvesting period is between December and March for winter plantation and from August to October for summer plantation. To take advantage of high prices, farmers in Sonebhadra as well in Samastipur were also observed to be growing tomato a little earlier with production ready around July. In IGP, the adoption of tomato has been very high especially by small and marginal farmers and it is grown by all types of vegetable growers.
 > Flexibility of growing all through the year, higher cost- benefit ratio, benefits of taking multiple harvests leading to higher cash flow and liquidity with returns spreading out over time make tomato cultivation an attractive proposition. India is the world's second larges tomato producer but processes less than 1 percent of its production. This impacts farmers by way of high post- harvest losses and low returns during periods of market glut. Earlier this crop was being grown only as a rabi crop in IGP but now its adoption has increased in late summer as wel as in early kharif especially in regions without water logging. Cultivation of tomato in later summer as well as in early kharif gives the price advantage to the growers. Due to changing dietary habits and reducing distance between rural and urban centres, one marketing-related challenge is that of easing out of the crop especially grown in late summer and early kharif. In the last 15 years, there has been significant increase in area, production and productivity of tomato almost across India, including in IGP. For the year 2017-18, the crop was grown in Bihar on 45.01 thousand ha with a production of 941.56 thousand MT. The productivity in Bihar is around 20.92 MT per ha. Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Patna, Nalanda, Begusarai, Samastipur and Purbi- Champaran, etc., are the main tomato producing districts in the state. In Uttar Pradesh, it was cultivated in 21.24 thousand ha with production of 841.61 thousand MT with productivity around 39.62 MT per ha. Mainpuri, Agra, Etah, Barabanki, Kannauj, Kanpur, Lucknow, Amethi, Sonbhadra and Mirzapur are some of the main tomato producing districts in Uttar Pradesh. Productivity, all India, is around 25 MT per ha with the area under crop of 789,000 ha and production of 19,759,000 MT. Complete failure of crops, shortage of yields, reduction in quality and increasing pest and disease infestations are some of the key challenges faced by farmers due to climatic variations. As input costs for tomato are very high (hybrid seeds and high usage of pesticides), small and marginal farmers are much more affected. To merely maintain basic quality, farmers regularly need to spray chemical insecticides/pesticides.","Understanding Climate Change

 Sub category:Crop Vulnerability and Adaptation Strategies","Climate Change Impacts on Tomato Cultivation, Tomato Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> Tomato is one of the crops most vulnerable to climate change and adverse climatic conditions cause severe damage to it. It is highly susceptible to increased temperature and drought-like conditions. It affects production as well as quality. The crop needs a controlled supply of water throughout the growing period to maintain quality and productivity. As the crop is sensitive to water deficits, regular water supply needs to be ensured in phases such as post transplantation, flowering stage and during fruit development.
 Long periods of heat stress also have very adverse impact on crop production as it affects the vegetative and reproductive processes of tomato leading to a reduction in yield and fruit quality.
 > Rains with high intensity can cause severe damage to plants both in the nursery as well as the initial days after transplantation.
 > During the ripening season, high rainfalls significantly damage both the quality and quantity of the tomato produced. Incidence of water logging causes serious damage to the tomato. Disease attacks have increased significantly with a high incidence of cases of complete burning of flowers and curling of leaves. Conditions such as erratic rainfall also lead to rapid wilting and death of tomato plants as the plant is highly sensitive to water logging. Long dry spells or high temperatures cause significant loss in productivity due to reduced fruit setting, smaller size and low-quality fruits. Climatic variations also affect post-harvest quality and further cause severe losses in the value chain. Variations in temperature, rainfall, humidity and dew affect the growth and spread of fungi and bacteria which affects the fruit's colour and appearance as well the shelf life after harvesting.
 > Farmers also reported that short duration varieties have much smaller harvesting period. The shelf life has also reduced from four to five days earlier to just one to two days now.","Understanding Climate Change

UNDP,"Sub Title:Climate Change Impact on Tomato Value Chain
 Category:Agriculture and Supply Chain Management
 Sub category:Tomato Value Chain Dynamics and Climate Resilience","Climate Change Impacts on Tomato Cultivation, Tomato Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders"," > In the last two decades, there has been a significant increase in the area under tomato crop, production and productivity. Unfortunately, the processing industry has not been able to match production. After China, India is the world's second largest tomato producer. However, when it comes to processing, hardly 1 percent of the tomatoes produced in the country are processed.
 > Availability of the suitable variety in adequate quantities and deterioration of quality in post-harvest phases are some of the key challenges in the value chain. When it comes to climate change, some factors that affect the value chain are the suitability of the quality of tomato grown for the processing industry, deterioration of quality during the harvest and post-harvest phase, limited shelf life and high usage of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. High temperatures with variations often lead to cracking in the fruit and decrease the tautness of tomato skin and strength. With increased splitting of tomato, the quality of produce becomes less preferable for processing and value addition. Deviations with respect to colour, fruit firmness, total soluble solids, soluble solids and sugar content make the tomato less viable for processors. Attacks of insects are also significant in high temperatures which also affects marketable fruit quality.
 > Traditional Value Chain
 The traditional value chain dominates the tomato value chain in the districts of IGP. This chain accounts for most of the tomato produced. Under this channel, most farmers/aggregators bring tomato to the urban markets/mandis. This market works according to the seasonality of production with huge price fluctuations during the season. As this channel is used for the bulk of the production, competition is high and sale prices low as compared to other channels. Farmers bring their produce to the trading centres and, based on quality and supply for that day prices are determined and procured by wholesalers who further sell the produce to retail vegetable vendors. Sometimes wholesalers also supply it to neighbouring districts. A small extension of this value chain involves commission agents who procure tomato from growers an supply it to wholesalers from where it reaches the consumer via retailer vendors. The loss in this value chain due to climate change is largely restricted to the tomato growers. As the supply pipeline used in this value chain is not efficient, it is difficult to assess how much loss can be attributed to climate change and how much to supply chain inefficiencies.
 >  Evolving Value Chain
 > This value chain is evolving in the region and its share is gradually increasing. In this channel, village-based aggregators directly develop contacts with institutional buyers and supply tomato directly to them. This channel is also used by local processors who supply processed products (ketchup/sauce, pure) to local eateries especially restaurants. Arrangements for supplies are informal and, in terms of deficit of supply, purchasers procure from markets. Similarly, if there is surplus production, commission agents supply it to local trading centres.
 > Processors Value Chain
 > In the study area, processors source tomatoes through different channels. Processed products manufactured by the sample processors include tomato paste/ pure, sauce and ketchup. They plan most of their procurement during peak season and when there is glut in market resulting in cheaper prices. Generally, tomatoes supplied to processing industries are inferior to the ones sold in the market which are largely used for direct consumption. Processors also have vendors for procurement of tomato from major production areas. Vendors pool tomatoes from farmers in clusters of villages and supply based on demand from these processing industries.","Understanding Climate Change

 Category:Agriculture and Supply Chain Management
 Sub category:Tomato Transportation and Cold Chain Infrastructure","Climate Change Impacts on Tomato Cultivation, Tomato Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders"," > Due to high perishability and shorter shelf-life of the product, transportation is one of the most critical factors in the value chain of tomato. The quality of tomatoes is affected at every level during transportation, starting from the farms to the end consumers. Supply chain bottlenecks and quality of the yield which is highly vulnerable consequently results in poor price realization for producers. In between, there are very high losses in the value chain. The biggest challenge for transportation and storage is the lack of a cold chain in the tomato value chain.
 > In the districts of IGP, there is lack of storage facilities around the production centres. The number of cold storages in Uttar Pradesh is higher than that in Bihar. Cold storages which we came across were largely designed for storage of a single commodity and operate mostly on a seasonal basis. In fact, most storage facilities are customized for storage of potato and other crops which requires similar temperatures.
 > For long term storage, ripe tomatoes need to be stored at temperatures of about 10-15°C while the existing cold storages generally maintain a temperature of 2 to 4oC which is required to be maintained for potato. If tomato is stored at that temperature, it leads to chilling injuries as well as loss of flavour which depends on the total soluble solids and pH of the fruit which is linked to temperature, heat stress and water availability.","Understanding Climate Change

UNDP,"Sub Title:Climate Change Impact on Tomato Traders
 Category:Agricultural Economics and Market Trends
 Sub Category:Tomato Trading and Climate Adaptation","Climate Change Impacts on Tomato Cultivation, Tomato Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> Both in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh produce is sold by farmers through the local aggregator or trader at the local mandi. In the kharif season, when the supply is low in comparison to demand, traders also visit villages to procure through the local aggregator or via a trader at the local or regional trading centres. Tomato traders have complained of the shortening of trading months for tomato.
 In recent years, the trading season has been shortening and is now available for two months only. This has disturbed the trading cycle of traders. Like farmers, traders too have reported that they have observed a reduction in the shelf life of tomato and resultant distress sale to processing units, incurring 40-50 percent losses. Traders have reported the direct impact of climate change on the logistic decisions as well. Lately, unseasonable rains and humidity are some of the climate variables that have had an important bearing on their decisions. Traders ar more cautious while placing orders now and observe the daily demand more closely.","Understanding Climate Change

UNDP,"Sub Title:Impact of Climate Change on Tomato Processing Units
 Category:Agro-Processing and Supply Chain Management
 Sub category:Tomato Processing and Market Dynamics","Climate Change Impacts on Tomato Cultivation, Tomato Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","> Representatives of processing units of tomato, consulted during the study, stated that the price and quality of tomato are important criteria while purchasing the tomato. They also said that farmers as well as agents prefer to sell to urban/peri-urban markets rather than to them as there is a price difference of INR 1 to 2 per kg. Demand by the processing industry has been continuously increasing over the last few years. To minimize the risks, processing units source tomato from different regions since it is available throughout the year in states such a Maharashtra and Gujarat. This year, due to a drought-like situation in southern states, the supply of tomatoes in (May to July) was drastically affected thereby increasing the prices and transportation cost by 20-30 percent.
 Processors also reported that most tomato varieties currently used by farmers for crop cultivation are more suitable for direct consumption. Most varieties produced in this area are those with the thin skin which are considered less suited for processing. Additionally, processors also face challenges related to cost in maintaining the stock of tomato. Tomatoes require cold storage systems for longer periods than a few days, and few processors prefer to maintain a stockpile of tomatoes for subsequent processing requirements.
 The very nature of processing of tomato by processing units reduces the impact of climate related quality changes on tomato. Due to decreasing shelf life, in recent years, the supply of tomato is in fact increasing for the processors as traders consider these units as the last resort to minimize their losses. On the other hand, processors are matching the shortfall in supply due to adverse climatic conditions from distant regions and sometimes even importing.
 These losses are primarily incurred during the transportation of tomatoes. In the absence of adequate storage facilities for a commodity like tomato, which has an extremely short shelf life, losses at the farmer level are maximum. Low value addition impacts farmers by way of high post-harvest losses and low returns during periods of market glut. Conversely, Indian tomato-based product manufacturers import significant quantities of tomato pulp and paste due to the non-suitability of locally grown varieties. This results in extremely low to negligible losses at the level of tomato processors.","Understanding Climate Change
