Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2742,ICAR,"Economic Benefits of
 Intercropping","Intercropping plays an important role in economizing the total cost of cultivation. It achieves this through savings in the cost of preparatory cultivation, irrigation, weed management, and interculturing operations. Additionally, intercropping generates mid-season income and reduces the risk of total crop failure. This makes it a valuable strategy for farmers looking to implement cost-efficient and climate-resilient farming practices."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2753,ICAR,"Enhanced Organic
 Farming Practices","The principles of successful adoption and recommendations for different agro-climatic regions have been developed over six years of experimentation. The cropping systems and packages proposed are tailored for specific agro-climatic zones. New organic input packages have been found to increase net returns by over 20% and organic carbon content by 10-15%, compared to conventional chemical farming practices. These environmentally friendly packages, which do not use any chemical inputs for pest and disease management, are highly suitable for the environment and climate resilient agriculture."
State Advisory for Farmers during COVID 19 lockdown,ICAR,"Ensuring Continuity in Agricultural
 Operations: Guidelines and Advisory","The ICAR issued guidelines to facilitate agricultural operations and post-harvest management amid the COVID-19 lockdown. Coffee growers who have harvested beans should dry them to a moisture content of 12-14% and store them in airtight containers to prevent spoilage. For mushrooms that are ready for harvesting but cannot be sold in the village, they should be sundried or placed above a chullah in an appropriate drying basket until their moisture content reduces to 5-8%. Harvested tree beans can be preserved by making pickles or by drying the seeds along with their cover. These measures ensure the continuity of farming activities and aid farmers during the lockdown."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2734,ICAR,"Integrated SRI: Boosting Kharif
 Paddy and Fish Yields","The kharif paddy yield increased from 2.89 tonne/ha to 6.16 t/ha with fish yield of 2.6 tonne/ha. The Integrated SRI system has potential to generate net profit of 268,600 ha-1 in the two years. The net water productivity (NWP) in the Integrated SRI system was enhanced from 0.31/ m3 (Conventional rainfed rice) to 18.91/ m3 in economic gain per volume of water. This highlights the significant improvements in both agricultural productivity and profitability, emphasizing the role of innovative and sustainable farming systems in achieving climate resilience."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2739,ICAR,Sugarcane-Potato Intercropping,"Sugarcane is a widely spaced crop (0.90 to 1.20 meters apart) that grows slowly at first and has a long duration until harvest, making it a one-time income-generating crop. This characteristic provides ample opportunity for intercropping with potato, a faster-growing crop, to generate mid-season income. Intercropping sugarcane with potato can enhance household nutrition and improve economic security, ensuring a diversified and sustainable agricultural practice. This method, advocated by ICAR, is particularly beneficial in regions like Jharkhand as part of climate-resilient agriculture strategies."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2741,ICAR,"Improved Agricultural Practices
 for Higher Returns","The total cost of cultivation under improved agricultural practices was ₹30,050 per hectare, compared to ₹24,400 per hectare using traditional farmers' practices. The total value of the product was ₹1,05,680 per hectare under the demonstration practices and ₹74,720 per hectare under the farmers' practices. This resulted in a net return of ₹75,630 per hectare under the improved practices, compared to only ₹5,320 per hectare under the traditional practices. These results highlight the potential for significantly higher returns through improved agricultural practices, offering a cost-effective solution for enhanced cultivation."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2703,ICAR,"Optimizing Fertilizer Use
 through Fertility Maps","The decision support system by ICAR enhances crop yield and efficiency through the use of fertility maps. This system allows for precise fertilizer application based on soil-test values, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about fertilizer use. By understanding the fertility status and yield targets of their fields, farmers can potentially save a significant amount of fertilizer. This precision farming approach can be applied from the field level to the block or village level, depending on the available information. Experiments in various states indicate substantial fertilizer savings when fertilizers are prescribed using soil-test driven data. This practice not only optimizes fertilizer use but also contributes to climate-resilient agriculture by minimizing excessive fertilizer application and its associated environmental impact."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2716,ICAR,"Cost-Efficient Bio-Enriched
 Compost Preparation","Preparation of Bio-enriched compost involves modest additional cost of the price of low grade Rock Phosphate and biofertilizer over that of normal compost. Every tonne of Bio-enriched compost requires around 170 kg rock phosphate and 10 kg of Azospirillum/ Azotobacter and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) biofertilizer. Considering the cost of Rock Phosphate 3/ kg and biofertilizer 75/ kg, additional cost for each tonne of Bio-enriched compost preparation is about ₹2,000/ only."
State Advisory for Farmers during COVID 19 lockdown,ICAR,"Safety Advisory for Agricultural Operations
 During Harvest Season","Simple safety measures and precautions while performing farm operations have been issued to farmers with respect to harvesting, threshing, storage, and marketing of major crops cultivated in Haryana. These measures cover wheat, mustard, gram, and various vegetable crops. Wheat in large areas will be ready for harvest after April 14th through combines. Due to untimely rain during March, wheat harvesting is delayed and will start after April 5th, with peak harvesting occurring between April 15th and 30th. In case wheat harvesting is delayed due to scarcity of combines or other reasons, the mature crop becomes prone to fire, necessitating adequate precautionary measures."
State Advisory for Farmers during COVID 19 lockdown,ICAR,"Safety Advisory for Agricultural Operations
 During Harvest Season","Approximately 70% of barley harvesting is completed mainly in southwest Haryana, with the remaining expected to finish shortly. Mustard, another significant rabi crop, has largely been manually harvested but threshing still needs to be done in most cases. The harvesting of gram and lentil is delayed due to recent rains, with the process expected to approach the first fortnight of April. Among the vegetable crops in the harvesting/picking stage are tomato, cauliflower, cucumber, other cucurbits, green coriander, and spinach. These vegetables are being supplied to the market. Farmers should follow guidelines for safe harvesting, threshing, and marketing during the COVID-19 lockdown to ensure safety and productivity."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2744,ICAR,"Sustainable Intercropping
 System","The ICAR has developed a sustainable intercropping system suitable for marginal and small farm holders, focusing on bio-intensive techniques. During the kharif season, a 1:1 ratio of maize for cobs and vegetable cow pea is grown on tractor-made broad beds with Sesbania in the furrows. In the rabi season, the furrows are utilized for mustard, and three rows of lentil are zero-till sown on the broad beds. In summer, three rows of green gram are zero-till sown on the beds, serving both for grain production and residue incorporation. This diversified cropping system promotes soil health and crop yield, contributing to climate-resilient agriculture."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2728,ICAR,"Reduced Tillage and BBF
 Planting for Rainfed Cotton","The technology is a package of reduced tillage, involving one harrowing and intercultural operation with pre-emergence herbicide, followed by Broad Bed and Furrow (BBF) planting for rainfed cotton. The BBF are formed by a BBF maker creating a one meter wide bed followed by a 50 cm wide furrow with a depth of approximately 15 cm. The cotton crop receives the recommended dose of fertilizers, including location-specific deficient micronutrients. This method aims to improve the efficiency of water use and nutrient management, making it suitable for climate-resilient agriculture."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2754,ICAR,"Sustainable Organic
 Farming Packages","The new package identified for each agro-climatic zone is expected to increase the net returns of the farmers by at least 20% by reducing the cost of production. Moreover, the timely availability of adequate chemical fertilizer is a national issue which can be addressed through the newly developed packages of organic farming in the cropping system mode. The packages of organic production in all the zones identified rely on the natural process of pest and disease management, thus reducing the cost of pesticides and herbicides. In addition, the package provides numerous benefits to the environment and society, as the production of organic products has its own advantages."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2758,ICAR,"Sustainable Wheat Residue
 Management","Mechanical harvesting of wheat using combine harvester leaves behind almost all crop residue in-situ. The common practice of burning these residues in the field to prepare for the succeeding kharif crop is wasteful, leading to the loss of valuable organic matter, nutrients, and affecting soil microbial populations in the surface layer."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2758,ICAR,"Sustainable Wheat Residue
 Management","A suitable alternative residue management strategy has been developed at the Indian Institute of Soil Science, Bhopal, through years of experimentation. The technology involves soil incorporation of wheat residue plus nitrogen supplementation through Farm Yard Manure (FYM) at 28 kg N ha⁻¹ (approximately 4 t FYM ha⁻¹) along with 25 kg P ha⁻¹ for rainfed soybean, and 68 kg N + 30 kg P ha⁻¹ for irrigated wheat (1+2 irrigations), which is more effective and profitable."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2764,ICAR,"Inward Sloping
 Bench Terracing","Inward sloping bench terracing is recommended for cultivation on lands with slopes ranging from 10 to 33%. The specifications include a 2.5% inward slope and a 1% longitudinal gradient for the benches, and a 0.5:1 or 1:1 slope for the risers. Inward sloping terraces are very suitable for high rainfall areas with deep, permeable soils, such as those found in the Nilgiris. This method can also be applied to similar areas in the Western Ghats in Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra, where high rainfall and steep slopes prevail, and crops requiring proper drainage are cultivated. When inward sloping bench terraces are adopted, excess runoff is directed towards the hillside rather than the valley side, ensuring safe disposal with minimal soil loss."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2712,ICAR,"Addressing Manganese
 Deficiency in Field Crops","Manganese deficiency is increasing in rice-wheat systems grown in Indo-Gangetic plains having highly permeable coarse-textured alkaline soils with low organic matter. The principle of any micronutrient, including Mn, recommendations for different crops and cropping systems is based on its available status in soil, requirements to meet the crops/cropping system, and fixation in soil complex and other losses. Durum wheat genotypes are more susceptible to Mn deficiency than aestivum wheat."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2712,ICAR,"Addressing Manganese
 Deficiency in Field Crops","Manganese (Mn) can be supplied through the sulphate salt of Mn, i.e., MnSO₄, either through soil or foliar. Three to four foliar sprays of 0.5-1.0% MnSO₄ solution is more efficient and economical for enhancing wheat yield in sandy soils. Foliar spray of MnSO₄ solution one before and two after first irrigation is effective in mitigating Mn deficiency in crops in Mn-deficient soils."
State Advisory for Farmers during COVID 19 lockdown,ICAR,"Agricultural Operation Guidelines
 Amidst COVID-19",Guidelines: Appraise and consult Agriculture Advisor or Agriculture Coordinator for any emerging problem in farm-related activities. Lentil is at harvesting stage while gram and wheat will take another 20-25 days to mature. Harvesting should be at proper maturity. No need to irrigate the field as there was good rain in recent past. Summer ploughing in the vacant field after harvesting of Lentil is essential.
State Advisory for Farmers during COVID 19 lockdown,ICAR,"Agricultural Operation Guidelines

Leafy vegetables like palak, chaulai, bathua etc. can be sown for the summer season. Mealy bug in mango and litchi can be controlled by spraying Imidacloprid 17.8%SL at a concentration of 1 ml per 3 liters of water. Mite in litchi can be controlled by using Ethion 50 EC at a concentration of 2 ml per liter of water. Powdery mildew in mango can be managed by applying the recommended fungicide."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2768,ICAR,"Bio-Fencing for Soil
 and Water
 Conservation","The technology of bio-fencing with ridge planting establishes bio-fence species quickly and reduces runoff and soil loss compared to flat planting. This method also prevents trespass by human beings and animals. Under Bellary conditions, Agave sisilana and Euphorbia tirucalli have proven to be the best bio-fence species, with Agave sisilana showing more promise. Bio-fencing has vast potential for preventing trespassing and serves as an effective measure of soil and water conservation in semi-arid regions. Additionally, implementing bio-fencing can play a critical role in climate-resilient agriculture by protecting the land and optimizing water usage."

Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2765,ICAR,"Improved Bench
 Terracing","Bench terracing with inward sloping resulted in reduction in soil loss and runoff ranged from 44.3 to 71.2%, and from 21.3 to 63.8%, respectively. Increase in the yield of potato ranged between 57.1 and 103% where terrace renovation (to inward sloping terraces) was carried out. Increase in the yield of crops like potato, carrot and broccoli ranged from 66.0 to 84% on new inward sloping terraces when compared with that obtained on sloping land. These benefits highlight the importance of bench terracing for enhanced soil conservation and improved agricultural productivity, making it a viable practice for climate-resilient agriculture. Implementing such practices can lead to sustainable farming in areas prone to soil erosion and water runoff."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2774,ICAR,"Stable Tea Cultivation
 on Terrace Risers","Double row parallel planting of tea (Thea sinensis) on terrace risers at a spacing of 0.75 m x 0.75 m helps to overcome the problem of riser instability. This instability results from farmers not providing the slope of 0.5:1 or 1:1 to the risers, as they often make them as vertical as possible to accommodate more crop rows. Additionally, this technology promotes crop diversification, resource conservation, and higher production from annual cropped areas in the Nilgiris. It is especially suitable for southern hilly regions where tea is grown and bench terracing is required for annual crop cultivation. The tea cultivation on terrace risers can significantly reduce runoff (27.46 mm) and soil loss (0.33 tonnes/ha/year). The cost of this technology is ₹ 50,000 per hectare for the initial two years. The impact and benefits include an additional net income of ₹ 22,000/year from one hectare of terraced land."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2755,ICAR,"Sustainable Wheat
 Farming Practices","Conservation agriculture aims to produce with minimum disturbance to soil and environment. The machineries such as bed planter, zero-till drill, strip-till drill and rotary-till drill can be used in wheat for resource conservation in terms of better benefit: cost ratio, energy output input ratio, water use and management of Phalaris minor."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2755,ICAR,"Sustainable Wheat
 Farming Practices","Performance results: Zero, strip and rotary till drills, and bed planter provided higher wheat yields (2-12%), net returns (7-18%), cost effectiveness (9-14%) and energy efficiency (20-29%); required lower specific energy (16-21%) and specific cost (4-6%); and reduced Phalaris minor (56-79%) and other weeds (66-79%), when compared with conventional sowing of wheat. These practices contribute to climate resilient agriculture by improving resource efficiency and reducing environmental impacts."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2759,ICAR,"Sustainable Residue
 Management Benefits","Wheat residue incorporation or retention coupled with application of 28 kg N ha¹ through fertilizer or organic manures is more beneficial than burning in terms of enhanced crop productivity and soil fertility. Wheat residue incorporation resulted in 20-22% higher yields in soybean and 15-25% in wheat as compared to residue burning. Compared to residue burning, the residue incorporation or surface retention caused a marked improvement in the soil organic carbon content. Irrespective of residue management option, the N supply through organic sources led to an appreciable increase in soil organic carbon."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2759,ICAR,"Sustainable Residue
 Management Benefits","Available P and K status of soil improved with residue incorporation and residue surface retention. Further, the residue incorporation or retention improved soil physical health in terms of a decrease in soil bulk density and an increase in the percentage water-stable aggregates and mean weight diameter. Utilizing such practices supports climate resilient agriculture by enhancing soil health and crop productivity, thereby mitigating the need for burning residues which contributes to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2743,ICAR,"Intercropping for Sustainable
 Rice Farming","The technology is applicable for the rice-rice system in the Western Ghat. In this zone, space and moisture are available between two rice crops. No other crop can be grown due to excess moisture. After harvesting rabi rice, a green manure crop like Sesbenia can be sown and incorporated into the soil after 40-45 days. This technology not only enhances productivity but also increases soil organic carbon as well as the physical and biological properties of the soil. These improvements help sustain productivity and provide additional nitrogen (N)."

 Soils: Impact, Solutions, and
 Application Strategies","About 40% of Indian soils are deficient in sulphur (S), leading to significant economic losses in various crops, particularly oilseeds and pulses. The inclusion of sulphur in a balanced NPK fertilization schedule in S-deficient soils has been studied extensively through numerous experiments conducted on farmers' fields. These studies varied in S status, sources, rates, and methods of application. Crop uptake of sulphur ranged from 5 kg to over 50 kg per hectare, depending on crop type, available S levels, availability of other nutrients, growth conditions, and cropping intensity. Effective sources for rectifying S deficiency include single super phosphate, gypsum, phospho-gypsum, ammonium sulphate, and bentonite pastilles. Pyrite, a good sulphur source, should be applied to moist soil through surface broadcast one month before planting to meet crop requirements. It's recommended that basal application of S sources be done, though they can also be applied at 25-30 days of crop growth, especially for oilseeds."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2727,ICAR,Farm Waste Compostability Kit,"Crop residue that decomposes faster can be composted in a shorter period. A simple kit for assessing compostability of farm waste has been developed. The kit includes reagents such as 'Reagent A' (Distilled water) and 'Reagent B' (3% w/v 2,3,5-Tetrazolium chloride in alcohol). Reagent B is added in finely powdered form. The time taken for the development of red color indicates the decomposability of the waste. Early production of a more intense red color indicates easier decomposability. Performance results show a satisfactory distinction between different light-colored crop residues. The estimated cost of this technology is 5 per sample. Adoption of this technology would lead to resource conservation and resource use optimization, which is crucial for climate-resilient agriculture."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2747,ICAR,"Sustainable Integrated

 -Based Fertilizer Management","In view of the ever-expanding multi-nutrient deficiencies in soils, site-specific nutrient management, which is considered as Fertilizer Best Management Practice, needs to be promoted to improve soil health and crop productivity. Inadequate and unreliable soil-testing facilities, poor awareness of farmers about balanced plant nutrition, and lack of appropriate policy are the major constraints in adoption of Fertilizer Best Management Practices. It is realized that the soil-testing service has not made the desired impact and farmers have not yet been able to adopt it in large numbers. On the other hand, on-station and on-farm experiments conducted under diverse agro-ecologies across the country established the significance of soil-test based balanced fertilizer use in improving crop yields and nutrient use efficiency."

Spurs are constructed at an angle to the stream flow to guide the stream along a desired alignment and prevent bank erosion. A well-designed series of spurs built along an eroding bank will check the erosion and induce siltation between the spurs. The silted bank may be put under perennial plantation subsequently. Attracting type of spurs having an angle from 20° to 45° have proven most stable, while deflecting type (angle=90°) spurs could be provided in long straight stretches. Spurs' foundations should be at least 1 to 1.5 meters deep and 2.5 to 3 meters wide along their length to prevent scouring damage. The most vulnerable part is the nose; thus, an extended foundation up to 1-2 m in front can be provided. Minimum spur base width is about 1.5 m, reduced to 1 m at the top for stepped structures.

 Spurs","The blockage ratio (projected length of spur/width of torrent) should be kept between 0.20 and 0.30; greater lengths increase damage risk. Protection to stream banks can be enhanced with supportive vegetation between spurs. Spacing between spurs should be 4 to 6 times the length of the spurs. Anchoring the bank (0.5-1.0m length) is critical for spur stability; earth fill compaction at the joint of the spur and torrent bank is necessary, and stone pitching of the anchor is recommended. Minimum stone size should be 22.5 cm, but smaller stones (up to 10-15%) can support larger irregular stones if undressed. Generally, 10 gauge (3.15 dia) GI wire is recommended, with a woven net opening size of 15 cm x 15 cm. An apron is a good protective solution, and reinforcing with vegetation improves efficiency.

Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2796,ICAR,"Acidification for Drip
 Irrigation Efficiency","The chemical clogging is a major problem for drip irrigation system users. In India, most of the water used for irrigation contains calcium and magnesium. Calcium carbonate is common in arid regions. Hydrogen sulphite with calcium carbonate greater than 40 mg/litre promotes the formation of precipitation in drippers, adversely affecting water application efficiency and crop yield. Specific ion concentration, water pH, and temperature play crucial roles in chemical clogging. Acidification is the only alternative to remove such clogging. The use of hydrochloric acid (36%), sulphuric acid (98%), and nitric acid (60%) as per schedule through drip irrigation systems can solve the salt clogging problem."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2796,ICAR,"Acidification for Drip
 Irrigation Efficiency","Algae and fungi are major contributors to biological clogging, restricting the path of emitters. Chlorination is the main remedy to control biological clogging. Generally, calcium hypochlorite, sodium hypochlorite, or chlorine gas can be used for chlorination treatment. Therefore, acidification and chlorination are very important for the uniform application of water to each plant and in every corner of the field. Information regarding acidification as per water quality for drip irrigation is not available, and farmers are not well aware of the acid injection rate based on the existing quality of the water source."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2796,ICAR,"Acidification for Drip
 Irrigation Efficiency","Following equation is recommended for the calculation of acid injection rate and constant for acid treatment through the drip irrigation system. The equation is applicable for a water pH of 7.3 to 8.5: I.R. = Y x Qs where I.R. is the acid injection rate through the drip irrigation system (lph); Y is the Acid Injection Constant (using HCL 36 %), and Qs is the water flow of the system (litre/sec). Y = -28.314 + 4.368 x [pH of water]. Farmers in the Parbhani region are adopting the technology for acidification of the drip irrigation system.

This inoculant can be used in perforated brick-tanks to compost various crop residues. Poultry droppings (8:1) or urea at 0.5% can be added to reduce the C:N ratio of the composting mixture."
Jharkhand - ICAR_NRM_Practices-2722,ICAR,"Microbial Consortium for Rapid
 Composting of Crop Residues","To further improve the composting process, rock phosphate (1%) along with the fungal inoculum (0.3 kg/tonne of moistened crop residues) can be applied. This technique results in compost with a C:N ratio of 15:1 within three months. The use of microbial consortia significantly reduces the decomposition time of biomass. The cost of this technology is ₹2,00,000. Applying this compost to soil enhances its structure and organic carbon content, benefiting integrated nutrient management and organic farming. The impact includes better soil fertility and structure, crucial aspects of climate-resilient agriculture."

Monsoon/Weather Situation: Normal onset followed by 15-20 days dry spell after sowing (Early Season Drought-Normal onset),"The ICAR has suggested a series of contingency measures to tackle early-season drought in mid-land sandy loam soils, specifically focusing on rice cultivation. Normal onset of the monsoon, followed by a 15-20 day dry spell after sowing, can be managed by staggered raising of nurseries or establishing community nurseries at reliable water sources. If rice population falls below 40-50%, retransplanting can fill gaps; for mortality above 50%, use fresh seeds for new transplanting. Ensuring uniform plant distribution, managing termite and disease in nurseries with Indofil M 45 and Chlorpyriphos, and using life-saving irrigation are also recommended. Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) with sprouted seeds in plastic drum seeders, increased seed rates, and life-saving irrigation for over-aged seedlings are advised for better crop stands. Address disease threats like sheath rot and grain discoloration by managing over-aged plants and providing protective irrigation using harvested rainwater (dovas)."

Monsoon/Weather Situation: Normal onset followed by 15-20 days dry spell after sowing (Early Season Drought-Normal onset),"In addition to recomended measures, weed management is crucial, including pre- and post-emergence weedicides to reduce crop-weed nutrient competition. Strengthen bunds in both transplanted and direct sown rice fields to prevent drainage and seepage losses. For other crops like maize, pigeonpea, lady's finger, blackgram, and soybean, raised bed broad furrow or ridge and furrow methods are recommended. Surface mulching with crop residue or Glyricidia tree lopping helps in moisture conservation. For over-aged seedlings, increasing the number of seedlings per hill (5-6 seedlings/hill) is advised. Dry seeding of rice should be paired with pre- and post-emergence weedicides. Split application of urea fertilizer and foliar sprays of KNO3, urea solution, or water-soluble fertilizers (19-19-19, 20-20-20, 21-21-21) can supplement nutrition during dry spells. The community should be made aware of constructing rainwater harvesting structures like dovas for recycling water during dry spells, supported by SHGs or state government subsidies."

Jharkhand - JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Palamau_Division,ICAR,C. Monsoon/Weather Situation: 6 Weeks Delay (Onset: 6th Week of July) - Early Season Drought,"The ICAR has identified several key aspects for managing agricultural activities in areas with midland red lateritic sandy soils, focusing on crop diversification and agronomic practices. During a monsoon/weather situation marked by a 6-week delay, leading to early-season drought, the suggested contingency measures include changing the crop/cropping system to more resilient varieties such as medium-duration rice varieties (e.g., Shabhagi Dhan, BVD 110, 111, IR 64 Drt 1, Abhishek) and hybrid rice varieties (e.g., PAC 801, 807, 25P25, 27P31). Alternative agricultural methods like raised bed or ridge and furrow methods for planting pulses, cereals, vegetables, and fodder crops are recommended. Examples of pulses and cereals include Pigeonpea, Maize, Niger, Horsegram, and Cowpea, while suggested vegetables range from Lady's finger, Tomato, Brinjal, Cucurbits, and Chili to leafy vegetables like Amaranthus. Fodder crops advised are Sorghum, Maize, Rice bean, Thin Napier, and Pearl millet, with specific varieties for late August-September like Berseem and Oat."

Monsoon/Weather Situation: 6 Weeks Delay (Onset: 6th Week of July) - Early Season Drought,"For ensuring agronomic efficiency, several measures are recommended: staggered nursery raising by MAT/DAPOG method, community-based nursery raising, and the use of early to mid-early duration rice varieties. Effective nursery management includes applying 1 kg N, 1 kg P2O5, and 1 kg K2O per 100 m2, maintaining seed rates of 80-100 kg/ha for improved rice varieties and 15 kg/ha for hybrid rice, and top-dressing these doses 10-15 days after sowing. Applying Carbofuron 3G at 300 gm/100 m2 in the nursery 10 days before uprooting seedlings, and ensuring proper spacing for DSR and transplanting methods, are vital. Fertilizer doses are outlined: 80:40:20 kg/ha N:P2O5:K2O for improved rice and 120-150 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, 40 kg K2O/ha for hybrid rice, applied in specific stages. Additionally, rice pest and disease management strategies include using Carbofuron 3 G, Monocrotophos, Quinolphos 25 EC dust, Propiconazole, Nativo, Beam, or Tricyclazole for controlling various pests such as stem borer, gall midge, and diseases such as false smut, blast, and termite. Similar pest and disease management measures are suggested for Pigeonpea, Blackgram, Greengram, and various vegetables."

Jharkhand - JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Palamau_Division,ICAR,CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR RABI,"For Wheat, surface seeding practices include increasing seed rate and Nitrogenous fertilizer by 25%, removing excess water by making deep furrows around fields, and planking after seed placement. Follow RDF, INM, and IPM practices, and apply pre-emergence weedicide. For Potato, adhere to seed treatment, proper spacing, frequent irrigation, and managing leaf curling, early and late blight, and grub infestation. Irrigate during cold days and nights to mitigate frost attacks and produce smoke during cooler periods. For Chickpea, seed treatment with Rhizobium culture, Phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB), and Trichoderma is advised. Management for collar rot and dry root rot is crucial, along with pre-emergence weedicide application and irrigation at critical stages. Follow RDF, INM, and IPM, and drench FYM treated with Trichoderma. For Lentil, a foliar spray of Sulphur and Boron is necessary along with proper seed placement, defined sowing windows, deep summer ploughing, and proper water management. Follow seed treatment with Rhizobium culture and PSB, and irrigate only at critical stages. Management for wilt disease requires one hand weeding followed by two hoeing sessions. Mustard crop management includes seed treatment, proper seeding rate, thinning and weeding at 30-35 DAS followed by irrigation, and adherence to RDF, INM, and IPM practices. Irrigate at three critical stages: 30-35 DAS, before flowering, and capsule/pod formation, and apply a second dose of Urea before flowering. Manage painted bug, aphid, and powdery mildew issues."

JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Santhal_Divison,ICAR,CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR RABI,"CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR RABI - Maize-Toria cropping system involves several critical agronomic management practices. The sowing window for Toria is the 3rd to the 4th week of September. Recommended varieties include PT 203 and Panchali. Key practices include rainwater harvesting, recycling, and deepening water storage structures (shallow and deep) in April and May. Conduct deep summer ploughing, strengthen and raise field bunds during these months. Ensure proper seed placement and use the optimal seed rate with correct crop geometry for better crop stand. Application of lime or dolomite (3-5 q/ha) and soil application of sulfur (20 kg/ha) and boron (1 kg/ha) for oilseeds, pulses, and vegetables are advised. Foliar spray of Urea (2%) at flower initiation and pod formation stages is beneficial. Follow seed priming (warm water for 4-6 hours) and seed treatment with fungicide-insecticide-rhizobium."
JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Santhal_Divison,ICAR,CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR RABI,"Further instructions include deep summer ploughing, irrigating only at critical stages, and using pre-emergence and post-emergence weedicides. Hand weeding followed by hoeing is recommended. Employ RDF (recommended dose of fertilizers), INM (integrated nutrient management), and IPM (integrated pest management). Increase water use efficiency using antitranspirants, reflectants, and mulches. Regularly monitor fields for disease and insect attacks, and use pheromone traps and attractants. Promote protected vegetable cultivation under naturally ventilated polyhouses and net houses. Zero tillage ensures proper seed placement for better germination, and one hand weeding followed by hoeing helps manage emergent weeds."

Distribution of plastic drum seeders through line departments and supply of improved and hybrid seeds through Lamps a month before monsoon arrival are also recommended. Farmers should link with departments and Birsa Agricultural University for updates on weather and alerts. Highlighting the importance of crop-weather insurance to handle losses due to drought or cyclone is crucial. These measures aim to raise awareness about climate-smart agriculture."
JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Santhal_Divison,ICAR,B. Extreme Weather Events,"Hail storm: Seedling/nursery stage - Vegetable nursery should be raised in poly house or proper arrangement of low height poly tunnels should be made in open areas or covered with plastic sheets or thatching should be done. At the vegetative stage, in vegetables, remove damaged parts immediately and apply insecticide followed by fungicide as prophylactic measures. Follow fertilization through foliar as well as broadcasting. In the reproductive stage, remove damaged parts immediately and apply insecticide followed by fungicide; use foliar and broadcast fertilization for proper fruiting. At harvest, safely sell in the market after grading for immediate returns."
JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Santhal_Divison,ICAR,B. Extreme Weather Events,"Heat Wave: Wheat Chickpea/pea: Seedling/nursery stage - For protection from heat and cold waves, sow rabi crops between the 2nd week of October to the 2nd week of November to protect the vegetative phase from frost and reproductive phase from terminal heat stress. Implement life-saving irrigation. At the vegetative stage, timely sown crops do not face heat stress, while very late sown (January) crops do; provide life-saving irrigation and frequent evening water sprays. In Chickpea, high soil and ambient temperatures (>35°C) favor dry root rot; control it by spraying Captan or thiram or carbendazim or ridomil MZ or Saaf @ 1.5-2 g/lt water. Reproductive stage - Provide frequent protective irrigation to minimize terminal heat stress. For Chickpea, use the same spraying protocol for dry root rot. At harvest, provide frequent irrigation to compensate for evaporative losses."
JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Santhal_Divison,ICAR,B. Extreme Weather Events,"Cold wave: Wheat: Seedling/nursery stage - The cold environment during tillering or branching favors more tillers in wheat and more branching in mustard, chickpea, lentil, and linseed crops, leading to high yield. However, it is detrimental for potato, tomato, brinjal, pea, creeper vegetables, and fruits. Apply balanced fertilizers, practice irrigation, and foliar nutrient spray. At the vegetative stage, perform light irrigation, mulching with crop residue/weeds, and apply fertilizers. Reproductive stage - Continue irrigation and fertilizer application. For Pigeonpea/Mustard/Linseed/Chickpea/Pea, the seedling/nursery stage of Mustard has prominent aphid attacks; spray Rogor (Dimethoate) @ 2 ml or Monocrotophos 36 EC @ 1 ml /lt water during evening. For linseed, Alternaria blight and powdery mildew are common; spray Double dose (Iprodione 25% WP + Carbendazim 25% WP) @ 2 g per lt. water, and Sulfex @ 3 g or Karathene @ 1 ml per lt water weekly during evening. In Chickpea, cold and wet environments cause collar rot, black root rot, wet rot; spray Krilaksil or Ridomil MZ @ 1.5 g per lt, and Double dose (Iprodione 25% WP + Carbendazim 25% WP) 2 g per lt. Address bacterial wilt and leaf spot with carbendazim @ 2g/lt and streptocycline @ 1g/10 lt. water. Reproductive stage - In Pigeonpea, address pod borer/sucking bug, mites, blister beetle insects, and sterility disease by spraying Profenophos 50 EC, methomyl 40 SP, or monocrotophos 36 SL. Enhance contact insecticides with DDVP @ 0.5 ml/l. For Mites and Aphids, use Dimethoate 30 EC @ 2ml/l; for Blister beetle, use synthetic pyrethroids such as Cypermethrin 10 EC @ 1.0 ml/l; for sterility mosaic use Dicofol 18.5 EC 2.5 ml with fumigants."
JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Santhal_Divison,ICAR,B. Extreme Weather Events,"Frost: Wheat - Vegetative stage, light irrigation and mulching with crop residue/weeds/straw/leaves. For Pigeonpea, exposure to smoke by burning waste material during night time throughout various stages of growth. For Tomato & Potato and horticultural crops (fruit), during the seedling/nursery stage, create smoke around the field by using waste materials or set fire with used mobile oil in north-west or west-north direction towards incoming cold waves. Use polythene or bamboo hoogli in small horticultural/nursery/cash vegetable crops during morning hour and remove it during daytime. In perennial or horticulture crops (fruit), follow frequent irrigation, mulching, thatching, creating smoke screens, and lighting of fire. During the vegetative stage, continue irrigation, earthing up, and create smoke as required. Reproductive stage - Prefer immediate harvesting and disposal. At harvest, harvest in dry weather. For Cyclones - Not applicable."

Key suggested contingency measures for crop management include ensuring life-saving irrigation and proper land tilling. If the kharif crop fails, it is advised to sow rabi crops such as safflower and pigeonpea in September to October. Other recommendations include spraying KCL at a 2% concentration followed by Urea at a 2% concentration, and harvesting mid-early rice crop at physiological maturity. Additionally, farmers are encouraged to cultivate vegetables like tomato, brinjal, capsicum, Shimla mirch, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, green pea, and potato based on suitability near and around turbinaries."
JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Santhal_Divison,ICAR,C. Monsoon/Weather Situation: Terminal drought (Early withdrawal of monsoon),"For effective climate-resilient agriculture, planning for the rabi crop involves preferring early sowing of crops like wheat, mustard, chickpea, linseed, and lentil either as sole crops or in intercropping systems such as Wheat + Chickpea (4:2) and Wheat + Mustard (4:3). Proper planning and timely irrigation measures are critical to mitigating the adverse effects of terminal drought on rice and other crops. Ensuring the cultivation of suitable vegetables can enhance food security and provide alternative income sources for farmers.

Monsoon/Weather Situation: Mid season drought (long dry spell, consecutive 2 weeks rainless (<2.5 mm) period","At the vegetative phase, in low land sandy clay loam soils, rice crop management and water conservation are crucial. During mid-season drought characterized by a long dry spell with consecutive 2 weeks of rainless period (<2.5 mm), certain contingency measures are suggested. Foliar spray of 2 per cent KCL followed by 1-2 per cent Urea is advised. Weeding should be done. Drought increases the crop's vulnerability to diseases like sheath rot and sheath blight. Maintenance of field sanitation followed by bi-weekly spraying with validamycin (2-3 ml/liter), Tricyclazole (6g/10 liters), or carbendazim (2g/liter) is recommended. Life-saving irrigation and soil nutrient & moisture conservation are essential. Foliar sprays of 2% KNO3 or 2% urea solution or 1% water-soluble fertilizers (19-19-19, 20-20-20, 21-21-21) can help supplement nutrition during dry spells. Life-saving irrigation through dovas, wells, ponds, check dams, and bora bandh is critical for sustaining the crop."

In case of subsequent rains, resowing is recommended for a better plant stand. If the crop damage is less than 30%, gap filling is suggested for all upland crops. For damage exceeding 50%, resowing is recommended. Excess plants should be removed to reduce crop stand and conserve soil moisture. Additional measures include water spraying in the evening and early morning, soil nutrient and moisture conservation, avoiding top dressing of urea during the dry spell, and opting for in-situ moisture conservation.

Monsoon/Weather Situation: Terminal drought (Early withdrawal of monsoon),"At the pre-physiological maturity stage of rice cultivation in MID LAND Sandy loam soils, during a terminal drought caused by early withdrawal of the monsoon, several contingency measures are advised. In case of a gundhi bug attack exceeding ETL (>2 gundhi bug/m2), it is recommended to spray Chlorpyriphos dust or Monocrotophos at a concentration of 1 ml per liter of water. To mitigate late-season drought impacts, foliar, node, collar, or neck blast outbreaks can be expected depending on the crop stage. Life-saving irrigation is crucial if possible. Additionally, instead of grain-purpose crops, farmers can opt for sorghum, pearl millet, maize, cowpea, blackgram, and greengram for fodder use."
JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Kolhan_Division,ICAR,C. Monsoon/Weather Situation: Terminal drought (Early withdrawal of monsoon),"Further contingency measures during a terminal drought at the pre-physiological maturity stage of rice include planning for the Rabi crop season. Ensure all necessary inputs for the Rabi season are secured in advance. In case Kharif crops fail, it is advisable to sow pre-Rabi catch crops such as Toria, Niger, Horsegram, blackgram, sesame, and linseed in uplands to medium lands. These strategies are critical for sustaining agricultural productivity under adverse climatic conditions."

The normal cropping system involves rice followed by fallow periods. To address early season drought due to a 2-week delay in monsoon (onset in the 4th week of June), the suggested contingency measures include changing the cropping system: replacing long-duration rice varieties (e.g., Swarna, BPT 5204, Rajshree) with medium-duration varieties such as Shabhagi Dhan, IR 64-Drt 1, and Abhishek. Hybrid rice varieties like Arize 6444 (Gold), Uday 111, PHB 71, 26P52, and 25P25 are recommended for transplanting. Agronomic measures include staggered nursery raising using MAT/DAPOG methods, community-based nursery raising, and following recommended fertilizer doses and integrated pest management practices. Specific seed rates are 80-100 kg/ha for improved rice varieties and 15 kg/ha for hybrid rice. Pest and disease management involves using Carbofuron 3G for stem borers, Monocrotophos for gall midge, Quinolphos dust for Gundhi bug, leaf folder, and brown planthopper, and spraying Propiconazole or Nativo for false smut and Beam or Tricyclazole for blast."
JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Kolhan_Division,ICAR,A Monsoon/Weather Situation: 2 Weeks Delay (Onset: 4th Week of June) - Early Season Drought,"In the contingency plan for early season drought with delayed monsoon, nursery management is critical. Recommendations include raising nurseries with 1 kg each of N, P2O5, and K2O per 100 m². Topdressing should be done 10-15 days after sowing. In the nursery, apply Carbofuron 3G at 300 gm per 100 m² 10 days before uprooting seedlings. Recommended spacing for direct-seeded rice (DSR) is 20 cm between rows, and for transplanting, it is 20-25 x 15-25 cm. Fertilization includes 80:40:20 kg/ha of N:P2O5:K2O (basal application of half N, full P2O5, and two-thirds K2O) with the rest before flowering. For hybrids, use 120-150 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, and 40 kg K2O/ha following a similar basal and topdressing schedule. Utilize plastic drum seeders for DSR and apply post-emergence weedicide. Pest and disease management measures involve Carbofuron 3G for stem borer, Monocrotophos for gall midge, Quinolphos dust for other pests, and propiconazole or Nativo for controlling false smut. Blast control is managed with Beam or Tricyclazole sprays."
JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Kolhan_Division,ICAR,A. Monsoon/Weather Situation: Normal onset followed by 15-20 days dry spell after sowing (Early Season Drought-Normal onset),"ICAR advises several measures for rice crop management during normal monsoon onset followed by an early season drought, which typically includes a 15-20 day dry spell after sowing. Staggered nursery raising and community nurseries near reliable water sources are recommended to mitigate delays. For fields with less than 40-50% rice population, gap filling by re-transplanting is suggested, while fields with over 50% mortality should use fresh seeding. Termite and disease management can be handled by spraying Indofil M 45 and Chlorpyriphos at 0.2%. Life-saving irrigation is essential, and Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) should be implemented upon receiving rain, using a paddy drum seeder with sprouted seeds and a 20-25% increased seed rate for a good crop stand. Gap filling from profuse tillers ensures uniform plant distribution. High yielding varieties should follow transplanting, while improved varieties can use DSR."
JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Kolhan_Division,ICAR,A. Monsoon/Weather Situation: Normal onset followed by 15-20 days dry spell after sowing (Early Season Drought-Normal onset),"During early-season droughts, late transplanted rice might face sheath rot and grain discoloration, hence monitoring and early interventions are crucial. Pre- and post-emergence weedicides are advised to control crop-weed competition. For nurseries, protective irrigation using harvested rainwater can prevent seedling over-aging and diseases like blast; avoid using urea in nurseries. Strengthening bunds to minimize drainage and seepage losses is vital for medium-land rice. Maize, pigeonpea, lady's finger, black gram, and soybean should follow raised bed broad furrow or ridge and furrow planting methods. Surface mulching with crop residue or tree loppings of Glyricidia and forming a thin soil mulch layer using a blade can prevent soil cracking."
JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Kolhan_Division,ICAR,A. Monsoon/Weather Situation: Normal onset followed by 15-20 days dry spell after sowing (Early Season Drought-Normal onset),"For over-aged rice seedlings (35-45 days), increase the number of seedlings per hill to 5-6. Nutrient and moisture conservation measures include dry-seeding of rice with pre- and post-emergence weedicides, split application of urea fertilizer, and supplemental foliar sprays. Applications like 2% KNO3, 2% urea solution, or 1% water-soluble fertilizers such as 19-19-19, 20-20-20, or 21-21-21 are recommended during dry spells to supplement nutrition. Protective irrigation remains crucial in these periods to ensure crop survival and yield stability. Strengthening field bunds and employing efficient water management practices are essential for maintaining soil moisture."
JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_South-chhotanagpur_division,ICAR,A. Unusual rains: Continuous high rainfall in a short span leading to water logging,"Suggested Contingency measures for various crops in case of unusual rains leading to waterlogging: For Pigeonpea/Sorghum/Pearl millet at the vegetative stage, prefer ridge and furrow method of sowing and ensure proper drainage through channels. Collect runoff water in Dovas for future use. During the flowering stage, similar practices apply, and avoid fertilizer application. In the post-harvest phase for crops like blackgram and other pulses/oilseeds, ensure sun drying followed by grading and storing. For Rice at the vegetative stage, safe disposal of excess water from the rice field is essential, along with bund repairing. Apply insecticides in the afternoon considering weather conditions. For partially damaged crops, retransplant to maintain plant population and ensure bunds are heavily dusted with specific insecticides if swarming caterpillars are observed. Bacterial leaf streak and blight can be controlled by spraying Streptocycline or Plantomycin immediately after each rain spell."

Unusual rains: Continuous high rainfall in a short span leading to water logging,"Disease and pest management: For Rice, during the vegetative stage, treat Sheath blight with Hexaconazole and Blast with Tricyclazole. During the flowering stage, treat Sheath blight with Hexaconazole, Blast with Tricyclazole, and False smut with Nativo. Post-harvest, ensure grains are properly sun-dried to minimize stored grain pest incidence. For Maize, treat stem borer with Carbofuron or Phorate during the vegetative stage and Sheath blight with Hexaconazole during the flowering stage. For various vegetables (e.g., Cucurbits, Tomato, Brinjal), pre-sowing treat soil with Carbofuran. Post heavy rainfall, bacterial wilt, leaf spot, and canker may occur; hence practices for soil root dip, drenching, and spraying fungicides like Ridomil MZ are recommended. For French beans, treat rust disease with Mancozeb during the vegetative stage and protect against pod borer and aphid attacks at flowering. Ensure all spraying stops one week before harvest and immediately sell produce in the market post-harvest."

JHARKHAND_2019_Dist_Agri_Contingency_Plans_Kolhan_Division,ICAR,C. Monsoon/Weather Situation: 6 Weeks Delay (Onset: 6th Week of July) - Early Season Drought,"To enhance soil fertility and crop productivity under delayed monsoon conditions, ICAR proposes several agronomic measures. Top dressing with urea and DAP should occur after rainfall. Lime or dolomite (3-5 q/ha) and compost should be applied a few days before sowing. Inclusion of leguminous crops can improve soil fertility, while Borax should be applied at 10-15 kg/ha. Short-duration, high-yielding, and low-water-requiring crops, such as Greengram, Blackgram, Soybean, Soybean, Seasame, Horsegram, and Niger, can replace traditional crops post-downpour. Weed control in vegetables is managed through mulching after cultural operations. In-situ moisture conservation in vegetables involves inter-cultural operations at 15-20 DAS. Foliar sprays of 2% DAP or 0.5 to 1% potassium chloride + 0.3% Boric acid, or 2% urea, are recommended at pre-flowering and flowering stages. Additionally, antitranspirants like growth hormones (ABA, Ethrel, TIBA) and reflectants (Calcium bicarbonate) can be utilized, and acidic soils should be ameliorated."

 Ranchi, Jharkhand","Rock Phosphate as source of phosphorus for
 acid soils","Birsa University, Ranchi, Jharkhand, provides scientific recommendations on plant protection and agricultural entomology. Notably, they advise the use of Rock Phosphates as a source of phosphorus for acid soils. Acid soils can increase the solubility of rock phosphate, making it slowly available to plants and reducing fixation. For strongly acidic soils (pH<5.5), it is recommended to apply Rock Phosphate at a rate of 2-3 quintals per hectare by the broadcast method during the final preparation of the land for sowing. For moderately acidic soils (pH 5.5 to 6.0), a mixture of Rock Phosphate and Single Super Phosphate should be applied in furrows at the time of sowing. This blend helps in improving the soil's phosphorus availability and is beneficial in making agriculture more climate-resilient."

Drought-proofing programmes based on employment schemes, together with watershed development approaches, agricultural credit cooperatives, and increased food productivity, contributed towards increasing availability of food in the rain-fed areas of the country. On the micro level, these steps ensured self-sourcing by improved farming and agriculture; on the macro level, food access to urban and rural areas was ensured by the open-market and non-open market distribution systems."
23_WOTR-FNS-Paper-Final.pdf,WOTR,Food and Nutrition Security and Climate Change: Strategies for a Sustainable Future,"However, after initial successes, India soon started experiencing the limitations of resource-intensive and chemicals-based agriculture. The pursuit of increasing production and widespread inappropriate use of chemicals has degraded land, resulting in lowering in-situ productivity. This has dragged farmers and cultivators into a vicious cycle of worsening land degradation with increasing chemical inputs, leading to further degradation of the ecosystems. This, together with the dependency on high-yielding variety (HYV) of grain, has led to an ever-increasing dependence on external inputs which is making agriculture unviable. Besides, reduction of soil fertility and the damage to agricultural ecosystems has also contributed to reduced crop-biodiversity."

 Ranchi, Jharkhand",Furrow method of lime application,"Birsa University Ranchi, Jharkhand recommends the furrow method of lime application to neutralize soil acidity and increase crop yield. This involves applying powdered lime or dolomite (80-100 mesh sieve) at a rate of 3-4 quintals per hectare. The process starts when the land is prepared for sowing. Furrows are opened at a distance suitable for the crop, and lime is applied in these furrows, followed by chemical fertilizers and treated seeds. The mixture is then mixed with soil, and the furrow is closed. This method helps in maintaining the right pH balance in the soil, which is crucial for optimal crop growth and is particularly important in climate-resilient agriculture as it enhances soil health and crop productivity."
https://iims.icar.gov.in/Institute_Details.aspx?Inst=CHTMioV3+yE=,Icar,Impact of Conservation Agriculture and Nitrogen Management on Maize-Pigeon Pea Crop Rotation,"In maize-pigeon pea crop rotation under conservation agriculture and nitrogen management practices, significant improvements were observed in pigeon pea seed yield and soil carbon levels. No-tillage and reduced tillage practices resulted in 24.1% and 12.8% higher pigeon pea seed yield, respectively, compared to conventional tillage. Additionally, soil carbon levels showed an increase of 12.2-22.9% in no-tillage and 5.6-10.6% in reduced tillage across different aggregate size fractions. These findings suggest that adopting no-tillage and reduced tillage practices can enhance both crop yield and soil health, contributing to climate resilient agriculture."
Pulses in Cropping Systems,ICAR,Effect of Pulses on System Productivity and N Economy,"Pulses are known for their soil fertility restoration value. Deep rooting, nitrogen fixation, leaf shedding ability and mobilization of insoluble soil nutrients are some of the unique characteristics of pulses. By improving chemical, biological and physical environment in the soil, pulses can arrest the declining trend in productivity of cereal-cereal system. Inclusion of pulses in intensive cereal based system itself is a component of integrated plant nutrient supply system. Therefore, pulses have become viable alternative to improve the soil health and conserve the natural resources and agricultural sustainability."

21_Biodiversity-position-paper.pdf,WOTR,Biodiversity: A Key for Adaptation to Climate Change,"Several farmers in the Akole taluka of Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra, India, plant crop varieties resistant to floods, drought, and other difficult weather conditions. Sattechiwadi is one such village located in the rain-shadow area, receiving about 500 mm of rain each year. Under these conditions, rice cultivation is typically precluded. However, farmers have successfully planted Dhobal, a drought-resistant rice variety, which is also widely grown in the village of Fofsandi that normally receives moderate to high rainfall. In Fofsandi, farmers grow nine varieties of traditional/indigenous rice cultivars to cope with weather variability. A diverse genetic base, combined with extensive traditional knowledge, is crucial for producing such resilient varieties. These indigenous cultivars and traditional knowledge form adaptive knowledge systems. In their absence, the systems would be suboptimal and likely to fail. In Sattechiwadi, farmers also grow Dhobal rice during the Kharif (monsoon) season on farms that do not exceed four acres and are situated along the village's main drainage line, which floods for a few days every monsoon. The Dhobal rice has two cultivars: one white and the other red."

When climate change is added, it further worsens the situation as food production, one of the critical ecosystem services, is impacted the most. Participation of rural communities, specifically the poor, women, and smallholder farmers who are food growers, is the key in addressing climate change related threats to food and nutritional security. Communities should participate in FNS related governance processes of decision-making, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. This includes government efforts such as the public distribution system (PDS), Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), and mid-day meal scheme."

Processing prolongs the shelf life of food and makes it available over distances; it is useful in reducing the burden on women, making cooking easier. However, the nutritional value of the food is reduced during the manufacturing process, though attempts are made to add supplements. Increased international trade in the wake of the globalisation, and de-regulation under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), has intensified this process."

In the recent past, these markets have also penetrated rural areas where there is a limited requirement but a growing inclination towards buying and consuming processed food. Processed food is like a two-edged sword for rural areas. On the one hand, it reduces the nutritional value of food during the manufacturing process, and on the other, it promotes monoculture through contract farming which is vulnerable to weather variations."
23_WOTR-FNS-Paper-Final.pdf,WOTR,Food and Nutrition Security and Climate Change: Strategies for a Sustainable Future,"Processed food changes traditional food habits, and together with monoculture, results in loss of diversity of locally available nutritious food that is consumed. It has greatly reduced the agro-biodiversity and the diversity of food grown on farms - both of which are local, climate friendly, and are a fall-back in times of weather variation. Contract farming for processed foods promotes mono-cultivation which affects soil health. Farmers of the Akole block of Ahmednagar district have indicated that during the last six to seven years, traditional crops (finger millet, native paddy and others) have been reduced to 25 per cent of what was grown earlier. Now external varieties of paddy (that have a better market) replace these.

"Understanding Climate Change
 Adaptation for Smallholders/Marginal
 Farmers",UNDP,"Climate Change Impacts on Paddy Cultivation, Paddy Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","Large traders and millers procure paddy after harvest and store it for three to four months. Stacks are arranged with a 1-metre gap surrounding them and a 1.5-metre clearance at the top. Paddy arrives from December onward, and average storage spans three to four months. It's crucial to maintain the moisture level below 14 percent to avoid moisture absorption from the air. Higher temperatures and humidity lead to increased storage insects/pests, necessitating more frequent fumigation, which drives up maintenance costs. The expansion of commercial warehousing has also contributed to additional warehouse space creation. Farmers generally grow the same variety, leading to simultaneous harvests. Farmers storing paddy in their warehouses have shorter durations, while traders' warehouses face competition in acquiring enough paddy to maximize space utilization."

 Technology in Pulse Based
 Cropping Systems",ICAR,Farm Mechanization and Pulses,"Direct drilling, also known as no-till drilling, is a practical tool for utilizing crop residues, particularly in the context of Rabi pulses after rice. These pulses often face delays due to factors such as late harvesting of rice, soil wetness, poor rice residue management, multiple tillage operations, scarcity of power sources, lack of appropriate farm equipment during peak hours, and occasional rain in November. Zero-till drills have demonstrated several benefits through various field experiences, including cost savings in seed bed preparation by approximately Rs. 2,500 to 3,000 per hectare, fuel savings ranging from 37.3 to 70 liters of diesel per hectare depending on soil condition, time savings in seed bed preparation and sowing, advancement in sowing time by up to 2 weeks over conventional systems depending on soil conditions, and water savings of up to 30%."

Green revolution strategies - manufacture of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, development of High Yielding Varieties (HYV) of hybrid seeds, and ensuring that farming communities had access to these at subsidised prices, coupled with large-scale canal irrigation systems, has led towards increase in food production and helped India meet the national food-production goals (Ziegler, 2006). Additionally, employment oriented drought-proofing programmes, together with watershed approaches and extension activities such as agricultural credit-cooperatives, and increased food productivity contributed towards this end in the rain-fed areas of the country."

The Public Distribution System (PDS), a nationwide network of low priced food grain shops regulated by public authorities, plays an important role in providing access to the urban and rural poor. In addition, targeted programmes such as Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) and Mid-day Meals in school programme were started to reach out to the vulnerable, especially children and pregnant women. This was a major shift in the policy focus, from mere supply of food to a child-care approach, aiming at provision of nutritious food to children through schools, and providing neo-natal and post-natal care, including facilitation of institutional, rather than home-based, birthing services."

 Cropping Systems",ICAR,Farm Mechanization and Pulses,"Farm mechanization is crucial for improving land and labor productivity, especially in the face of rising wage rates and labor shortages during peak hours. The use of precise and timely mechanical equipment for various farming operations, such as land preparation, leveling, sowing, planting, irrigation, fertilizer application, plant protection, harvesting, and threshing, enhances the efficiency of inputs and reduces losses. For instance, sowing seeds at the correct depth and applying fertilizer uniformly can only be achieved with proper mechanical devices. Indigenous methods, on the other hand, often result in reduced efficiency and longer durations for multiple operations, impacting cropping intensity. Mechanical equipment with higher output capacity and fewer required operations help increase the area under cultivation and cropping intensity. These benefits are not exclusive to farmers with large holdings; small farmers can also utilize improved farm equipment through custom hiring to boost productivity and lower production costs."

 Cropping Systems",ICAR,Farm Mechanization and Pulses,"Direct drilling in combine harvested rice field requires a drill capable of cutting through large quantities of crop residue, penetrating untilled soil, and dropping seeds 25 to 50 mm deep. Disc openers meant for trashy conditions fail to cut through the crop residue, resulting in the seed being placed either in the residue or on the soil surface. In softer soil, the trash is pushed into the bottom of the furrow without being cut. With fixed-type furrow openers, crop residue tends to collect in front of the Tyne and block the machine operation. There is a need to develop a device that can cut residue and help the openers penetrate up to the desired depth for seeding."

Structural degradation, loss of organic matter, erosion, and falling biodiversity are all expected consequences. Soil erosion resulting from tillage has forced us to look for alternatives and to reverse the process of soil degradation, leading to the promotion of conservation tillage, especially zero-tillage in many parts of the world. Over the past two decades, these technologies have improved and been accepted by farmers in India, mostly in the Indo-Gangetic plains.

Consequences of climate change on the species component of biodiversity include changes in distribution, increased extinction rates, changes in reproduction timings, and changes in the length of growing seasons for plants. Some already-threatened species are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and climate variability. Changes in rainfall distribution, temperature, flooding, and sea level rise will be the most obvious effects on ecosystem boundaries and the functions within them."
21_Biodiversity-position-paper.pdf,WOTR,Biodiversity: A Key for Adaptation to Climate Change,"As a result of changes in functions and shifts in boundaries, some ecosystems will expand into new areas, while others will become smaller. Habitats will change as rainfall and temperatures change, and some species will not be able to adapt, leading to a sharp increase in extinction rates. Global warming is also causing shifts in the reproductive cycles and growing seasons of certain species, which can in turn affect how ecosystems function. The equilibrium of ecosystems can also be upset when insect pests and microbial pathogens, previously unknown in a region, survive the warmer winters. Migrating species may be affected dramatically by any alteration to stop-over sites key to their survival, or when seasonal availability of food sources is no longer in sync with the duration of such migration."

Frost in February 2012 in the Akole region was an indication of this. It will take a long time to see the visible impacts of climate change with reference to shifts in ecosystem/habitats. Yet, changes in the habitat due to agricultural expansion are clearly visible. There is a shift in habitat amongst species; habitat generalist species like Pied Bushchat and Indian Black Robin are spreading into forested ecosystems. Moisture indicators like moss and lichen have been observed to be disappearing from trees or rocks around the villages where these were once abundant.

Pulses in Cropping Systems,ICAR,Effect of Pulses on System Productivity and N Economy,"Aggregate stability is a crucial soil quality parameter to assess long-term soil quality. Crop rotations including pulses enhance aggregate stability and soil structure due to the production of glomalin by fungi in the pulse crop rhizosphere. This glycoprotein binds soil minerals, organic matter, and debris to form stable soil aggregates. Higher soil aggregate levels over 0.25 mm were recorded where legumes were the preceding crop. Bulk density, another critical parameter, decreases in crop sequences that return ample residues to the soil. Incorporating mungbean stover in rice-wheat-mungbean sequences results in lower bulk density and better hydraulic conductivity. Legume roots, rich in nitrogen and capable of deep soil penetration, promote earthworm activity, improving soil porosity and water percolation. The All India Coordinated Pulses Improvement Project (AICPIP) reported significant improvements in soil physico-chemical properties after seven crop cycles involving mungbean or urdbean."
Pulses in Cropping Systems,ICAR,Effect of Pulses on System Productivity and N Economy,"Pulses have a unique ability to lower soil pH, creating a favorable environment for nutrient availability and microbial activity. They obtain most nitrogen from atmospheric N2 rather than soil NO3, effectively reducing soil pH, especially in neutral and alkaline environments. Among legumes, chickpea most significantly reduces soil pH, followed by pea and pigeonpea. Pulses also add substantial organic residues, rich in nitrogen, promoting decomposition and microbial activity. Rabi pulses contribute notable amounts of N, P, and K per hectare, and pigeonpea adds substantial nutrients through leaf drop. Studies show improvements in organic carbon and total nitrogen in soil when substituting cereals with legumes in crop rotations. Pulses leave significant amounts of residual nitrate nitrogen, especially chickpea, benefiting subsequent crops. Kharif pulses increase soil nitrate (NO3) during their growth."

Chickpea can mobilize sparingly soluble Ca-P in Vertisols and pigeonpea can dissolve Fe-P in Alfisols. Pulses improve microbial soil environment and release unused symbiotic nitrogen-fixed nitrate into the soil along with low molecular weight compounds, enhancing microbial populations. Inclusion of mungbean in crop systems like rice-wheat and maize-wheat increases soil microbial biomass carbon and dehydrogenase enzyme activity, an indicator of soil microbial activity.

However, most short duration varieties suffer from sterility mosaic, fusarium wilt, and Phytophthora blight, and tend to prolong maturity with late monsoons. To improve adoption and profitability, new varieties with early November maturity and high yield potential are required. Additionally, in regions like Bihar, East Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Orissa, and Assam, pigeonpea is grown as a pre-rabi after kharif maize, early rice, minor millets, or jute. The crop promises better performance in areas with mild winters due to its temperature sensitivity."
Pulses in Cropping Systems,Icar,Cropping Systems Involving Pulses,"Rice-Urdbean/Mungbean/Lathyrus: The cultivation of urdbean and mungbean during the rabi season in Southern India's coastal regions has gained momentum after the development of powdery mildew-resistant genotypes like LBG 17, LBG 402, LBG 611, and LBG 22. This development revolutionized urdbean and mungbean cultivation in rice-fallow areas, particularly in Andhra Pradesh. This cropping system improves soil health and offers high productivity and stability. Recently, it has been adopted in states like Orissa, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. The benefits of this system also include better land utilization and increased resilience to climate variations."

Beyond its role in food security, it also provides employment and livelihoods to millions of rural households. Sowing begins in November and harvesting is completed by early April. During 2016-17, India produced approximately 98.38 million metric tons (MMT) of wheat over an area of 30.6 million hectares, with an average productivity of 3.2 metric tons per hectare. Wheat farming in IGP is largely reliant on irrigation, and irrigated land supports both self-consumption and marketable surplus production.

This region benefits from favorable climatic conditions, including cool, moist winters that facilitate plant growth and dry, warm weather from late February onwards that aids grain ripening. The soil type in IGP is also conducive to wheat cultivation. Unlike rice, the chances of complete wheat crop failure in IGP are minimal. The coping mechanism for climatic and rainfall variability is more robust for wheat than for rice. Wheat cultivation starts under retreating monsoon conditions, with farmers applying two to three rounds of irrigation followed by fertilizer application. Climate change, expected to raise maximum winter temperatures and reduce low-temperature days, could impact wheat growth, especially in the middle parts of IGP."

Understanding and implementing climate resilient agricultural practices are crucial for maintaining and potentially enhancing wheat productivity in the face of climate change. This context aligns with efforts to support smallholders and marginal farmers through climate-resilient strategies."
Pulses in Cropping Systems,ICAR,Cropping Systems Involving Pulses,"The utera/paira, a type of cropping commonly practiced in Bihar, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Chattisgarh, and Orissa, is a relay method where lentil/lathyrus/urdbean/mungbean seeds are broadcast in the standing crop of rice about 2 weeks before its harvest. This practice leverages the better soil moisture available at the time of rice harvest, which would otherwise be lost. Experimental evidence shows that paira cropping produces higher yields of lentil than planting after rice harvest with tillage. The Utera system does not allow agronomic interventions such as tillage, weeding, irrigation, and fertilizer application. However, the rice variety impacts the productivity of pulses in this system. Issues needing resolution include long-duration and photosensitive rice varieties, seedling mortality causing inadequate plant population, rare fertilizer use, weed infestation due to lack of post-emergence herbicides, and terminal moisture stress. In South Eastern Uttar Pradesh's rainfed Vindhyan region, chickpea is grown after rice. Chickpea sowing is often delayed by 10-15 days after rice harvest to allow soil to reach proper moisture after pre-sowing irrigation and seedbed preparation. This delay, especially when sowing occurs at the end of November, can significantly reduce chickpea yield. However, sowing chickpea using the Utera method in a standing rice crop about 10 days before rice harvest can yield 45% more than sowing after proper seedbed preparation. The development of zero-till drills now facilitates sowing of wheat/chickpea/lentil immediately after rice harvest in moist soil."

Long-term trials at IIPR also showed SOC improvements in systems like rice-chickpea, rice-wheat-mungbean in lowland areas, and maize-chickpea, pigeonpea-wheat, and maize-wheat-mungbean, as compared to traditional rice-wheat and maize-wheat systems. The inclusion of pulses not only increases nutrient availability in the soil but also enhances soil physical and biological properties, leading to better soil fertility. Similar trends were noted in lowland rice-based systems. Pulses are known to improve microbial activities in the soil by releasing unused fixed nitrogen, which promotes the breakdown of carbon-rich residues from non-leguminous crops. Additionally, the dehydrogenase activity, an index of soil microbial activity, was higher after legume harvest compared to cereals. Overall, pulses contribute to increased diversity of soil flora and fauna, resulting in greater soil stability."

Both the size of the tuber as well the number of tubers is reduced in such a situation. In order to adapt to frequent temperature variations, small and marginal farmers have reported use of shorter duration varieties that mature much earlier than the traditional varieties. These varieties can be harvested in 70-90 days which not only helps the farmer in avoiding the high stress periods by strategically sowing the crop but also gives higher income as early harvested potato fetches a higher price in the market.

It is highly susceptible to increased temperature and drought-like conditions. It affects production as well as quality. The crop needs a controlled supply of water throughout the growing period to maintain quality and productivity. As the crop is sensitive to water deficits, regular water supply needs to be ensured in phases such as post-transplantation, flowering stage, and during fruit development.

Biological efficiency is likely to improve when legumes are included in the cropping system as intercropping because they explore the same soil mass more thoroughly, compared to sole cropping and may be able to take up the nutrients from a place and a form which are inaccessible (Saraf and Patil 1995). Multi-locational trials on mode of fertilizer application in pigeonpea based intercropping system showed that recommended dose for the cereal component of the system is sufficient to achieve yield of component crops almost equivalent to those obtained with the recommended dose of nutrient applied to both the components."

 Farmers",UNDP,"Climate Change Impacts on Paddy Cultivation, Paddy Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","Flattened rice is an important segment within the paddy value chain. This traditional product is prepared from soaked paddy that undergoes heat treatment and immediate flattening with a flaking machine. The paddy is soaked for two or three days to soften the kernel, then boiled for a few minutes. After boiling, the paddy is dried in a shallow earthen vessel or sand until the husks break open. The kernel is flattened and husk removed using a wooden pestle, and the final product, thin and white flaked rice, is obtained by winnowing. However, processors have reported issues like a higher percentage of broken rice and poor-quality paddy, which are critical as whole, healthy grains are necessary for good flaked rice. The percentage of empty shells in the supply has increased by about 2-3 percent."
"Understanding Climate Change
 Adaptation for Smallholders/Marginal
 Farmers",UNDP,"Climate Change Impacts on Paddy Cultivation, Paddy Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","The processors of flattened rice are struggling with the inconsistent quality of paddy and are seeking new geographic sources for raw materials. However, this leads to higher transportation costs, which increase the procurement price by 1-2 percent. Previously, firms would keep only two or three days’ worth of stock due to regular supply, but now competition among traders and millers has forced them to maintain stocks for eight to ten days. This change has increased the interest cost for the firms. Moreover, labor costs for cleaning and transportation have also risen. To address these quality issues, some processors have invested INR 200,000 to 250,000 in purchasing sievers to minimize impurities. This investment is part of their adaptation strategies to ensure the quality of flattened rice remains high despite the ongoing challenges."
"Understanding Climate Change
 Adaptation for Smallholders/Marginal
 Farmers",UNDP,"Climate Change Impacts on Wheat Cultivation, Wheat Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","Production of wheat has been consistent in the last few years, so value chain participants do not get affected by production fluctuations, one of the key impacts of climate change. To mitigate quality-related impacts of climate change, traders and millers are adopting stringent quality parameters at the time of procurement. Most millers have now invested in developing inbuilt facilities for drying (both sun and machine) of wheat. Large roller mills and flourmills are impacted by climate change due to increased cost of drying or rejections of wheat at the time of milling due to inferior quality or presence of foreign matters in the wheat."
"Understanding Climate Change
 Adaptation for Smallholders/Marginal
 Farmers",UNDP,"Climate Change Impacts on Wheat Cultivation, Wheat Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","Wheat with low moisture content, high shine, heavy and uniform grain, and low impurities are considered good raw material. However, recent years have seen increased humidity, leading to higher moisture levels in wheat. Millers attribute the formation of small wheat grain (muniyadana) to climate change, which, due to their small size, gets mixed with filtered impurities, causing production losses of around 2-3 percent. The early onset of summer also affects wheat grain quality, magnified at the grain filling stage, leading to reduced grain size. Untimely rain before or during harvest results in discoloured wheat, compelling farmers to harvest prematurely, increasing impurities by 1-1.5 percent."
"Understanding Climate Change
 Adaptation for Smallholders/Marginal
 Farmers",UNDP,"Climate Change Impacts on Wheat Cultivation, Wheat Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","Millers report that wheat with higher moisture content tends to consume more energy during processing, and although exact correlations are difficult to quantify, a pattern of higher energy consumption is observed. The use of drying units, which wasn't common earlier, has led to a 10-15 percent increase in electricity consumption. The extraction proportion for products like maida and sooji also depends on the wheat’s moisture content, affecting maida quality. To meet quality requirements, the cost of processing has increased due to investments in advanced machinery like sievers, grinders, and driers. Over 80 percent of these losses occur at the stage of organized roller flourmills, with the rest at unorganized mills. Increased operational costs due to adherence to quality parameters highlight the adverse impacts of climate change on wheat yield quality. Over the next decade, climate change variations can significantly impact quality and productivity, increasing overheads at the processing stage."

 Cropping Systems",ICAR,Farm Mechanization and Pulses,"The success of conservation agriculture in rainfed areas depends on two critical elements, namely residue retention on the surface and weed control. Residues are generally used as fodder in drylands, thus necessitating the determination of the minimum amount of residue that can be retained without affecting the crop-livestock system. Initially, emphasis may be given to crops whose residues are not used as fodder. More research is needed on weed management under minimum tillage from a cropping system perspective. Additionally, the identification of alternative sources of fodder for livestock is crucial to spare crop residue for conservation farming."

No farmer will sacrifice residue in dryland areas. In contrast, in irrigated regions like the Indo-Gangetic plains, higher production leads to more crops per year, thus reducing residue competition. Managing feed supplies over the transition period from conventional agriculture to a conservation agriculture (CA) system is also a significant challenge."

Its impact on agriculture could threaten the livelihoods of many households dependent on agriculture and allied activities. Agricultural productivity is affected by climate change both directly (due to changes in temperature, precipitation, and CO2 levels) and indirectly (through changes in soil, pest infestations, and diseases). Water deficit conditions combined with thermal stress could adversely affect important food crops like wheat and rice. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) found that increases in temperature (by about 2°C) reduced potential grain yields in most places. Reductions in yields are predicted to be more pronounced for rain-fed crops as opposed to irrigated crops. In subtropical environments, the decrease in potential wheat yields ranged from 1.5 to 5.8%, while in tropical areas, the decrease was relatively higher."

Growth and development of agricultural value chains are essential for economic empowerment, especially for small and marginal farmers. Climate change affects the entire value chain from producer to final consumer, impacting the quality and quantity of agricultural products and the value addition made by value chain agents. Climate change impacts lead to higher operational costs for value chain actors, particularly small businesses, due to increased electricity charges, fumigation expenses, and lower capacity utilization in storage facilities.

It leads to increased costs for warehouse and cold storage operations due to higher electricity and fumigation expenses. The vulnerability of small businesses in the value chain is higher due to limited financial resources and inadequate planning and preparedness. The adoption of short-duration high-yielding varieties (HYV) by farmers affects the business of traders, warehouse owners, and processors. Increasing moisture content in raw materials impacts processing costs and conversion ratios. Value chain actors mitigate climate risks by adopting strategies like alternate procurement sources, improving supply chains, and investing in new plants and machinery. However, this increases their financial risks. Limited studies have focused on post-harvest value chain impacts, leading to insufficient policy inputs and responses to develop climate resilience in post-harvest value chain agents."

The available literature highlights the climate risks associated with various commodities and a few actors of the value chain. It focuses on the climate risks such as increasing temperature, uneven rainfall, floods, drought, etc., and its impact on agriculture production systems; 2. The literature also looks at mitigation measures undertaken by farmers or companies/businesses at the production stage, as most direct climate risks and exposure to vulnerability are more evident at the pre-harvest stage. The deterioration at this stage results in an indirect impact up the value chain; 3. There have been a few studies which explain commodities such as maize, rice, wheat, etc., but fail to highlight the impact of climate change on different actors along the chain."

There are very few documented evidences of post-harvest adaptations in value chains. It is in this context that the present study 'Understanding climate change adaptation for smallholders/marginal farmers and quantifying its impact on agri-allied value chains in Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP)' is of significance in exploring the gaps identified in the studies reviewed above.

Many farmers have experienced the disappointment of carefully raising a crop only to have it damaged or destroyed by an invasion of pests. The practice generally carried out by farmers in such situations is to spray crops heavily with pesticides. This results in significantly higher input costs for farmers, not to mention health and environment hazards. Thus, there is a need for more environmentally friendly pest control methods. One such system is the Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which is an eco-friendly approach that aims at keeping pest population at manageable levels, with minimal use of pesticides. Instead, it employs a combination of alternate pest control methods and techniques with emphasis on the use of bio-pesticides and pesticides of plant-origin like Neem formulations."
Ecologic_July-2019.pdf,WOTR,Ecologic A WOTR Newsletter July 2019,"One village that is seeing this kind of transition to the use of nature friendly bird perches is the Chincholi village of Jalna district, Maharashtra. Agriculture is a mainstay of the village and cotton is the main cash crop. Gajanan Hiwale, a farmer from the village owns four acres of land on which he grows soybean, cotton and chickpea. The story of Gajanan focusses on the issue of farmers distress due to the exorbitant price of chemical pesticides. Earlier, Gajanan grew soybean, cotton and maize on his field, but his crops suffered much due to the attacks of leaf-eating caterpillar and girdle beetle on soybean, sucking pests on cotton, white grub on maize and pod borer on chickpea. He says, 'I used to spend around Rs. 9-10,000 on chemical pesticides for my 1.5 acre chickpea plot. To buy pesticides, I had to go to Rajur market, which is 10 km away from my village. I have also heard about the health issues due to these chemical pesticides which made me even more apprehensive, but I was not aware of what I could do.'"
Ecologic_July-2019.pdf,WOTR,Ecologic A WOTR Newsletter July 2019,"To address this issue, it was found that farmers were using chemical pesticides to an excessive degree, leading to deterioration in the soil health. For the next few seasons, the use and benefits of intercropping of bird perches in 10 to 12 'demo plots' of farmers in every village were demonstrated. The project was not just limited to the use of bird perches. The use of biocontrol agents, bio-pesticides, and integrated pest-disease management techniques were also taught in farm field schools (FFS). Gajanan had attended the FFS in 2016 and after learning about the bird perches, he grew sorghum (bird perches) with chickpea (main crop) in his field. He says, 'Earlier, I used to spray chemical pesticides three times a year; but now I just spray it two times or sometimes less than that. The rest of the pests are taken care by sorghum (bird perches) grown in my field. The birds who come to eat the Sorghum also end up eating the pod borer pests, thus controlling their spread.' It gave him an apt solution for his pest problem because his annual expenditure has reduced by about 30% for his chickpea crop since he started using the bird perches. In Jalna district, the problems of pod borer and army worm infestation are severe, and hence both organic practices and bird perches farming are needed to reduce the frequency of chemical spraying. When farmers saw the benefits of using bird perches with their own eyes, they themselves started taking it up. Currently, over 40 farmers in Chincholi village are practicing integrated pest management."

 Cropping Systems",ICAR,Residue Management and Pulses,"Crop residues are portions of plants remaining after seed harvest. Residues are important in nutrient distribution and plant growth as they affect the amount of soil nutrients available to crops. Plant residues influence N cycling in soils because they are primary sources and sinks for C and N. Residues allow N to be available to plants for longer periods through initially immobilizing, and then gradually mineralizing N. However, in many parts of the tropics, crop residues are burnt in the field due to the ignorance of farmers about their value and lack of proper technology for in situ incorporation of residues. Burning one tonne of straw releases 3 kg particulate matter, 60 kg CO, 1460 kg CO2, 199 kg ash, and 2 kg SO4-2. Consequently, proper management and incorporation of crop residues can enhance soil fertility and climate resilience."

Long-duration pigeonpea in northern India can add up to 2.8 t/ha leaf litter during the crop season, whereas chickpea can add up to 1.7 t/ha. On average, the nutrients contributed by these leaf litters vary between 8-15 kg N, 2.5-5.0 kg P, and 8-24 kg K per hectare. Incorporation of crop residues is important for improving soil properties, productivity, and fertilizer use efficiency. For example, in rice-chickpea sequences, rice-residue incorporation with chopped straw, irrigation, and 20 kg N/ha significantly increased chickpea seed yield compared to residue removal treatments."

In Uttar Pradesh, maize is primarily grown in the kharif (monsoon) season, while in Bihar it is cultivated in both rabi (winter) and kharif seasons. Due to its photo-insensitive nature, maize has wider adaptability and can be grown in all cropping seasons. Kharif maize is short duration, while rabi maize has a longer duration and superior transpiration efficiency, making it less water-intensive and highly versatile for the market. Both the cultivation area and production of maize are increasing, especially in the central IGP. Average grain yield varies from 2-2.5 MT per hectare in kharif to more than 4 MT per hectare in rabi.

 Farmers",UNDP,"Background, Introduction and Methodology","Among the five states that come under IGP, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were selected for this study. The study focused on districts identified from among the top 37 vulnerable districts by NICRA. The vulnerability of the districts and their ranking were determined based on sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity. Eight indicators using gridded meteorological data for the period 1951-2009 were used for computing exposure while sensitivity was computed from six indicators based on crop and soil characteristics. Computation of adaptive capacity was based on socio-economic indicators of agricultural technology, infrastructure, and human development. Spatial datasets of key indicators contributing to agricultural vulnerability were generated for 161 districts in IGP. The study found that districts in eastern and southern parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were more vulnerable, whereas districts in Punjab and Haryana have low vulnerability due to their higher adaptive capacity to recover from climatic stresses. A total of 115 districts were identified from 28 states with at least one from each state. The selection of districts was made by a committee using a composite index of key data sets. Based on these criteria, a total of 14 districts were identified (nine from Bihar and five from Uttar Pradesh)."
"Understanding Climate Change

 Farmers",UNDP,"Background, Introduction and Methodology","The selection strategy considered two districts each from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to be included, representing diversified agro-climatic conditions. Districts were further evaluated based on the centrality of agriculture and value chain centrality. For example, in the case of wheat, district-wise production was multiplied by the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the final usage of wheat was assessed. Agri-climatic zones were defined as land units expressed in terms of climatic conditions suitable for certain crops. India has 15 agro-climatic zones and 73 sub-zones. Out of the two identified states, Bihar has three important agro-climatic zones (North-West, North-East, and South). Similarly, Uttar Pradesh has nine agro-climatic zones as recognized by NITI Aayog. The districts of Sonebhadra and Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh and Katihar and Samastipur in Bihar were identified based on these multi-criteria analysis including the highest crop production, crop diversity, and better infrastructure and connectivity."

 Farmers",UNDP,"Background, Introduction and Methodology","The final shortlisted districts for the study were Samastipur and Katihar from Bihar, and Sonbhadra and Bahraich from Uttar Pradesh. Important crops from the categories of cereals and horticulture were selected for the value chain study. The selected crops included paddy, wheat, and maize from the cereals group, and potato and tomato from the horticulture group. These crops are prominent in the states and make significant contributions to national-level production. The study underscored the importance of diversified crops, better infrastructure, and the potential for value creation in selected districts to enhance climate resilience. The detailed methodology and multiple contextual filters used in district selection provide a robust framework for climate-resilient agricultural practices."
Pulses in Cropping Systems,ICAR,Effect of Pulses on System Productivity and N Economy,"It has been estimated that 668,000 tonnes of nitrogen can be incorporated in the soil through the inclusion of legumes in cropping systems. The intrinsic nitrogen fixing capacity of pulse crops enables them to meet a large proportion of their nitrogen requirement and also helps in economizing nitrogen in succeeding non-legume crops due to the residual effect. Different legumes have different capacities to leave behind varying amounts of N for use by the succeeding crops. In sequential cropping involving pulses, the preceding pulse may contribute 18-70 kg N/ha to the soil and thereby considerable amounts of nitrogen to succeeding crops. The beneficial effect of pulses was more pronounced in maize as compared to sorghum after chickpea and pigeonpea whereas after lentil and peas, the higher N-equivalent benefit was observed after pearl millet."
Pulses in Cropping Systems,ICAR,Effect of Pulses on System Productivity and N Economy,"Growing of short duration legumes such as green gram and cowpea in widely spaced crops and ploughing back the same in the soil after picking the grains resulted in an advantage of 30 kg N/ha on fertilizer basis in Alfisol of Hyderabad. Incorporation of crop residue of mungbean in the rice-wheat system not only added 100 kg N/ha to the soil but also maintained high availability of N during various growth stages of rice. In a three-year experiment on sandy loam soil of Kanpur, Kushwaha and Ali reported significant improvement in productivity and N economy in wheat preceded by kharif legumes. Cowpea was most beneficial followed by pigeonpea and pigeonpea + mungbean. The soybean-wheat system was most productive followed by pigeonpea-mungbean-wheat among kharif pulse-based cropping systems."
Pulses in Cropping Systems,ICAR,Effect of Pulses on System Productivity and N Economy,"The nitrogen economy due to preceding pigeonpea over sorghum was 51 kg N equivalent/ha. Influence of rabi pulses on productivity and N economy in succeeding rice revealed that chickpea and lentil exhibited the most favorable effect in economizing nitrogen to the extent of 40 kg/ha. Among summer pulses, mungbean-rice was most productive (6620 kg/ha) followed by fodder cowpea-rice, which was mainly attributed to the residual effect of nitrogen by the legumes. In Oxisols of Vamban, the highest grain yield was recorded in cowpea-maize sequence followed by urdbean-maize. The superiority of cowpea as preceding summer pulse was attributed to its higher N fixation capacity and higher addition of plant residues in the soil, which enriched soil fertility and promoted the growth of succeeding crops. An overview of N economy of cereals and cropping systems in different agro-climatic zones under pulse-based cropping systems showed that N economy in different zones varied from 30-67 kg/ha. Further, biofertilizers have a profound effect on succeeding cereal crops. Observed beneficial effect of urdbean inoculated with Rhizobium on succeeding wheat crop."

 Farmers",UNDP,"Climate Change Impacts on Wheat Cultivation, Wheat Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","Most stakeholders reported that overall growing conditions have been favourable for wheat in 2019. The extended winter conditions also helped to harvest a better yield. The government's preliminary estimate (Second Advance Estimate of 28 February 2019) for the year expected a production of around 99.1 MMT. The value chain participants confirmed that they had more production in 2019. FCI, along with state agencies, procured more than 35 MMT of wheat in the 2018-19 marketing year (April-March) on the back of a bumper crop. Around 30 to 35 percent of the wheat produced by farmers is used for self-consumption; around 5 percent is stored for seed while the remaining produce is marketable surplus. Sudden rains, hailstorms, or heavy winds can destroy or damage the wheat crop, making it suitable only for animal feed. The by-product from wheat milling (wheat bran-chokar) is also used for cattle feed. Three types of value chains exist for the wheat crop: regulated value chain, organized value chain, and unorganized value chain."

Processing of flour (atta) is mainly carried out in grinding stone mills (chakki). The value chain for roller flourmills is more organized, while the value chain for atta is largely unorganized except for a few large players. In the regulated value chain, FCI procures wheat on behalf of the Government of India from farmers through state-level cooperatives or nominated agencies at a pre-declared price under MSP. Major contributors of wheat to the government procurement system include Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan. More than 30 percent of the wheat produced is procured by government agencies, especially in Uttar Pradesh. The wheat procured is allocated to various state governments for distribution through PDS at a subsidized price. In years of surplus procurement, the government also sells wheat in the open market to stabilize OMSS."

In Bihar, wheat trading is driven by private traders who supply wheat to roller flourmills, while in Uttar Pradesh, farmers directly supply to wheat mills. This value chain supports large units of roller mills. Wheat is used by roller flourmills with a conversion rate of around 97 percent, producing fine flour (maida), semolina (rawa-suji), residual flour, and bran for cattle feed. Most of these roller mills have capacities of 20 to 50 MT per day and operate at 60-70 percent capacity. Organized flourmills grind and sell wheat flour under their own brand names or through contract grinding for branded flour manufacturers. This value chain is highly impacted by climate change, as millers must maintain high quality despite climate-affected impurities and invest in high-end machinery to mitigate climate change effects."

Most mills do custom milling for farmers, small traders, or consumers who procure wheat from farmers or small aggregators. Production of flour from wheat is done by grinding stone mills (chakki), which is preferred for the unique aroma and texture of the flour. These mills generally have a processing capacity starting from 2 to 3 quintals per hour. The impact of climate change on this value chain is lower as participants rarely engage in storage and branding. However, there is an increased cost of milling due to additional labor for manual cleaning and washing of wheat."

Farmers have reported that their traditional wisdom for predicting pre-monsoon conditions has become unreliable. Common adaptations include changing to high-yield varieties (HYV) and hybrids, adjusting planting and harvesting dates, altering tillage and rotation practices, increasing fertilizer and pesticide use, and improving irrigation and drainage systems. Farmers also use short-duration and low water requirement seed varieties to cope with delayed and insufficient rains. The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) has been adopted to optimize water resources and reduce pesticide use, leading to increased yields. Despite these measures, the quality of paddy is often affected, with issues such as hollow or semi-hollow shells, decreased grain weight, and more frequent occurrences of underripe paddy."
"Understanding Climate Change
 Adaptation for Smallholders/Marginal
 Farmers",UNDP,"Climate Change Impacts on Paddy Cultivation, Paddy Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","The impact of climate change on the value chain of paddy varies with the type of value chain. In the traditional rice value chain, locally grown paddy is de-husked in village mills, with the impact mostly affecting the end consumers who deal with higher percentages of broken rice. In the transitional rice value chain, common in IGP, village-based aggregators sell paddy to urban markets, where it is then procured by rice millers and sold through wholesalers. Losses during storage range between 4-5%, primarily due to quality issues. To mitigate losses, rice millers have adopted technologies like rubber roll shellers and parboiling, although these require additional capital and operational costs. Long value chains, which involve extensive inter-state trade, face the highest risks and impacts from climate change due to multiple intermediaries and longer storage times. The regulated value chain, most prevalent in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, is less affected by climate change due to relaxed quality standards during procurement and supply by state agencies."

 Cropping Systems",ICAR,Pulses: Component of RCT,"Sequential cropping is a multiple cropping system where two or more crops are grown in sequence on the same land within a crop year. Pulses are introduced in cereal/oilseed-based cropping systems to disrupt the monotony of crop rotation. They are low-input crops that can mitigate the risk of crop failure due to poor rainfall and adverse weather. They enrich soil fertility and improve nitrogen economy. Early pigeonpea-wheat sequence was more promising than traditional rice-wheat in irrigated areas of Punjab, Haryana, central, and western Uttar Pradesh. Early pigeonpea genotypes like UPAS 120, Pusa 992, Manak, AL 15, AL 201, and ICPL 88039 showed potential. Inclusion of pulses in the rice-wheat system increased productivity and improved soil fertility. Under irrigated conditions, rabi pulses like rajmash, chickpea, and field pea increased rice crop productivity compared to wheat. Crop rotation with rabi pulses economized nitrogen by 40 kg/ha over wheat. Summer legumes like mungbean, soybean, and groundnut improved wheat yield more than maize. Mungbean as a catch crop in summer provided a bonus yield and economized nitrogen for the subsequent rice crop by 34 kg/ha. In lowland areas of eastern UP, Bihar, and parts of MP, rust-resistant high-yielding lentil varieties were suitable for the rice-lentil sequence."

After three years of research, rice genotype NDR 359 and chickpea genotype BG 256 recorded significantly higher rice equivalent yield (10,633 kg/ha), net returns, and benefit-cost ratio. Among different chickpea lines, IPC 2005-61, DCP 92-3, and BG 372 were found most suitable for the rice-chickpea sequential cropping system. Short duration high-yielding varieties like Uday, Amber, HUR 15, and HUR 137 of rajmash have been successfully introduced under irrigated conditions in central and eastern plain zones. Cropping sequences like rajmash-mungbean and rajmash-urdbean were found most remunerative. The yield of summer legumes after rajmash was higher than after wheat and chickpea due to timely planting. In lowland irrigated conditions, the rice-rajmash-mungbean system was most productive and remunerative, followed by rice-wheat-mungbean. The benefit-cost ratio of rice-lentil and rice-field pea was higher due to low input costs."

Deviations with respect to color, fruit firmness, total soluble solids, soluble solids and sugar content make the tomato less viable for processors. Attacks of insects are also significant in high temperatures, which also affects marketable fruit quality. The traditional value chain dominates the tomato value chain in the districts of IGP. This chain accounts for most of the tomato produced. Under this channel, most farmers/aggregators bring tomato to the urban markets/mandis.

A small extension of this value chain involves commission agents who procure tomato from growers and supply it to wholesalers from where it reaches the consumer via retailer vendors. The loss in this value chain due to climate change is largely restricted to the tomato growers. As the supply pipeline used in this value chain is not efficient, it is difficult to assess how much loss can be attributed to climate change and how much to supply chain inefficiencies.

The seed rate for sole crops should be full quantity, and reduced by 30-40% for intercropping according to spacing. Fertilization (RDF) should be reduced by 1/3rd for intercrops. Weed control measures include the use of atrazine for maize as pre-emergence, and imizathyper or pendimithilin @ 1 kg/ha for pulses, along with flucloralin or basalin for soybeans and vegetables. Construction of bunds for unbunded upland areas is suggested. Application of well-rotten FYM with 1/4th N, and full P and K basal application is advised for vigorous seedling growth of vegetables. Moisture conservation methods include the ridge and furrow technique for cereals, pulses, and vegetables. Intercropping is advisable to deal with the consequences of occasional drought. RDF should be followed for all upland crops with the addition of sulfur @ 20kg/ha for pulses and oilseeds, and phosphogypsum applied @ 120 kg/ha for soil application. Applying lime or dolomite (3-5 q/ha), sulfur, and phosphogypsum (30 kg/ha) with compost a few days before sowing is suggested."

Non-leguminous seeds should be treated with fungicide + insecticide + soil application of azotobacter @ 2kg/ha. Foliar application of a 2% urea solution + lime is recommended for lady's finger. Apply required fungicides and insecticides if population count exceeds ETL or as a prophylactic measure. Including leguminous/pulse crops in the cropping system is advised to improve soil fertility. Borax should be applied @ 10 kg/ha. For in-situ moisture conservation in vegetables, follow intercultural operations by making ridges and furrows at 15-20 DAS. Cultivate vegetables like brinjal, tomato, cucurbits, lady's finger, chili, coriander leaf, amaranthus leaf, arvi, dolichos bean, cole crops, French bean, and cowpea.

Millers observed that high temperature impacts the paddy crop during the ripening stage in the following ways: decrease in grain weight, reduced grain filling, and higher percentage of white chalky and milky white rice. Regular increases in temperature and prolonged periods of drought-like situations in the midst of the rainy season affect the moisture content in the paddy which leads to a higher percentage of broken rice. Millers reported that, in recent years, the percentage of broken rice has increased by 2 to 3 percent.

Millers who have arrangements with FCI/ State Food Corporations for custom rice milling are still in the business due to relatively easier quality control norms, benefits of by-products and lower requirement of working capital. Rice millers foresee a shift towards rice parboiling, as it helps in eliminating chalkiness in milled rice grains. The process of steaming and drying reduces grain breakage during the milling process and increases grain translucency. It also increases grain hardness and manages to reduce grain breakage as a result of the swelling of the starchy endosperm during gelatinizing. Millers reported that, though this process is effective in minimizing broken rice, shifting to steam-based plants is expensive and small and medium entrepreneurs cannot always afford the cost of technology upgradation as well. Another adaptation has been in terms of a shift to rubber roll sheller as this leads to a smaller percentage of rice breakage."

The potato processing industry is split between large manufacturers in the organized sector and small regional manufacturers in the unorganized sector. The organized sector dominates with branded products, and the unorganized sector mainly consists of small players with no or lesser-known brand names. The processing industry in the IGP region remains constrained to unorganized sectors due to unsuitable potato varieties grown in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, which accumulate high amounts of reducing sugar during cold storage, affecting taste and appearance.

Pulses in Cropping Systems,ICAR,Economy in Fertilizer Use,"There is a substantial residual effect of nutrients in cereal-pulse based cropping sequences. Application of phosphorus to chickpea was beneficial to succeeding rice, giving a substitution effect of 20-30 kg P2O5/ha compared to P applied to rice in a rice-chickpea sequence. Rhizobium and the application of 40 kg P2O5/ha in chickpea increased the yield of succeeding maize and fodder crops significantly. In the urdbean-wheat sequence, a net saving of 25% of fertilizer could be made in wheat. Application of phosphorus to pigeonpea significantly increased the growth and yield of succeeding wheat, allowing for a 50% reduction in phosphorus application. In a chickpea-upland rice system in Alfisol of Hyderabad, residual P response in rice was significant up to 40 kg P/ha. The inclusion of pulse crops enhances integrated nutrient management, similar to benefits from organic manure."
Pulses in Cropping Systems,ICAR,Economy in Fertilizer Use,"Response to sulfur up to 20 kg/ha in chickpea sustains yields in a rice-chickpea system, and sulfur applied to pigeonpea can be omitted in succeeding wheat without yield loss. Field studies in pigeonpea-wheat sequences showed that applying RDF + Zn+B+Mo to pigeonpea resulted in a significant residual effect on wheat yield (5000 kg/ha) compared to control (4000 kg/ha). Pigeonpea equivalent yield was highest (3148 kg/ha) with this treatment. Application of 5 t FYM/ha significantly increased pigeonpea seed yield and had residual benefits for wheat yield in the pigeonpea-wheat system. The rice-chickpea system proved productive and profitable (Rs. 30,777/ha net returns) with recommended phosphorous and compost application."
Pulses in Cropping Systems,ICAR,Economy in Fertilizer Use,"In maize-chickpea systems, the seed yield of chickpea increased significantly with the application of 30 kg S and 5 t FYM/ha, though the residual effect of kharif applied S was not conspicuous without direct S application to chickpea. Crop residue application increased sorghum yield by 26% in a sorghum + pigeonpea intercropping system. Residue management studies of kharif mungbean showed a yield gain of 15.6% in the rabi crop, and mungbean residue incorporation substituted 50% of the NPK requirement for rabi sorghum. These practices support climate-resilient agriculture by improving nutrient use efficiency and enhancing crop yield stability across different cropping systems."
"Understanding Climate Change
 Adaptation for Smallholders/Marginal
 Farmers",UNDP,"Climate Change Impacts on Potato Cultivation, Potato Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","Cold storage units are the most important link in the potato value chain. Potato is a highly perishable commodity and with its harvest time coinciding with rise in temperature in IGP, there is high risk of rotting and wastage of potato. From April onwards, temperature in the plains increases rapidly, and produce has either to be consumed within a short period or shifted to cold stores. Due to the expensive and unevenly distributed nature of cold storages, there are cases of oversupply in the market causing economic losses in the value chain. Unlike cereals where storage is primarily driven by traders, in potato, a large proportion of cold storage users are farmers. Storage begins in March-April till September onwards; no activity takes place in cold storage from mid-November to middle of February. Most cold storages close in December and January for maintenance activities."
"Understanding Climate Change
 Adaptation for Smallholders/Marginal
 Farmers",UNDP,"Climate Change Impacts on Potato Cultivation, Potato Value Chain and Adaptations by Various Stakeholders","The two critical environmental factors involved in properly storing potatoes are temperature and humidity. Adequate and unrestricted air movement is also necessary to maintain constant temperature and humidity throughout the storage pile, and to prevent excessive shrinkage from moisture loss and decay. The charge for potato storage is INR 2,000-3,000 per MT with a condition of 6 to 8 percentage weight loss. The impact of climate change on cold storage occurs in two ways: electricity charges due to high rise in temperature; and humidity management. A longer summer season and delayed monsoons also affect the operations of cold storages by increasing the operational costs of running as they require larger amounts of electricity to maintain the optimal levels of temperature and humidity in the cold stores. As reported by cold storage owners, their electricity consumption units have increased by about 10-12 percent in the last few years. This amounts to INR 75 to 100 per MT."

It is one of the most intensely farmed areas and is popularly known as food bowl of India due to its high contribution in production of cereal crops, especially rice and wheat. It produces around 50 percent of the total food production of which lentil production is close to 70 percent of the total production in the country. Wheat producing states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Punjab, which along with Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, collectively contribute around 90 percent of total wheat production in the country are from the IGP region. The leading rice producing states, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and West Bengal, are from the IGP region and together produce close to 35 percent of the total rice production in the country."

 Farmers",UNDP,"Background, Introduction and Methodology","NITI Aayog has, on the basis of agro-climatic zones, divided this area into four major sub regions: trans Gangetic plain; upper Gangetic plain; middle Gangetic plain; and lower Gangetic plain. The present study has focused on districts from upper- Gangetic plains and middle Gangetic plains. Both regions are known for fertile soils, favourable climate and generally abundant supply of water. The concentration of small and marginal farmers with small land holdings is very high in these regions. The major crops grown in this area are rice, wheat, maize, chickpea, lentil, mustard, potato, sugarcane and vegetables. Rice- and wheat-based cropping systems cover most of the area from these two regions which can be attributed to climate suitability, better adaptability, availability of high yielding varieties and increasing mechanization of both crops. The productivity of most crops in this region is close to their yield potential due to the presence of favourable agro-climatic conditions including productive alluvial soil, maximum irrigated land, sub-tropical climate, etc. Agricultural practices adopted by farmers are highly input intensive with higher usage of resources such as fertilizer and water which contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well."

 Farmers",UNDP,"Background, Introduction and Methodology","IGP is significant from the point of production of major food grain crops. Characterized by a favourable climate, fertile soils and abundant water supply, IGP is seen as the bread basket of South Asia, providing food and livelihood security for hundreds of millions of its inhabitants. It is also known as India “bowl of food grains because it contributes 48.4 percent of rice and 74.7 percent of wheat of the total Indian production of these two major food grains crops. Most areas of these plains have two to three crops in a year. Wheat, potato and mustard are the major crops of the spring (Rabi) season and paddy is grown in autumn (Kharif) season."
"Understanding Climate Change
 Adaptation for Smallholders/Marginal
 Farmers",UNDP,"Background, Introduction and Methodology","The climatic trends of IGP show that the temperature of this region is increasing year by year. According to a weather trend variability analysis done for the IGP region, the average temperature of this region has increased by 0.2 centigrade (C) per decade from the year 1960. The range of possible temperature increase for IGP is 0.6-2.7°C, 0.5-3.1°C and 1.0-5.4°C above the 1970-1999 mean for the 2030s, 2050s and 2090s, respectively. In general, temperatures in the monsoon period increase less than in the dry seasons. The research indicates that though average precipitation of the plains is static, the timing of precipitation is changing. A study was conducted by the Centre for Environment Science and Climate Resilient Agriculture on assessment of impacts on rice and wheat in IGP using the climatic data based on the PRECIS regional climate model developed by the Hadley Centre, United Kingdom, in nine representative locations of IGP. The study suggested the occurrence of extreme temperature events which could cause yield reduction, particularly if these events coincide with sensitive stages of crop growth. Apart from differential growth and yield responses of crop species to high thermal stress, the study also suggested differential response to high temperature stress during various growth phases. The results indicated that an increase in temperatures adversely influences crop performance and these negative impacts of temperature are not compensated enough by elevated carbon-dioxide (CO2) concentrations as is evident from a reduction in overall projected yields. Results also project occurrence of low yielding years more frequently due to climate change."
"Understanding Climate Change
 Adaptation for Smallholders/Marginal
 Farmers",UNDP,"Background, Introduction and Methodology","IGP is an environmentally sensitive, socially significant and economically strategic domain of India where landscape, hydrology and fertility are threatened by climate warming and anthropogenic pressure. A decline in food production will be the major problem. In order to assess environmental changes, concerted efforts should be initiated to understand the geological past and model the future. Even a rise in temperature by 2°C can lead to a fall in farm production between 4 and 34 percent (IPCC, 2007). The soil salinity, already prevalent in the plains of Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh, is bound to extend over the marginally saline areas, reducing the availability of agricultural land. This will place additional stress on the already declining water table. Groundwater exploitation is likely to be intensified and consequently water stressed areas will become water scarce. According to another study on the current rice-wheat system scenario in IGP, a good correlation is indicated between rainfall and rice yield as shown by statistical and remote sensing data analysis. The study’s findings mention that the current scenario of climate changes, i.e., global warming, rising temperatures, irregular pattern of rainfall, excess use of fertilizers and irregular pattern of irrigation significantly contribute to a decline in the fertility of lands."
"Understanding Climate Change
 Adaptation for Smallholders/Marginal
 Farmers",UNDP,"Background, Introduction and Methodology","The risk of climate change to agriculture is very significant in IGP due to its high dependency on rainfall and its connections to the tectonics and climate of the Himalaya. Thus, any change in these factors will have an adverse effect on the hydrology, soil fertility, food production and settlement patterns of IGP. Incidence of pests and diseases would be most severe in tropical regions due to favorable climate/weather conditions, multiple cropping patterns and availability of alternate pests throughout the year. Climate change is likely to cause a spread of tropical and subtropical weed species into temperate areas and to increase the numbers of many temperate weed species currently limited by the low temperature at high latitudes. India is the third highest GHG emitter. Agriculture and livestock together account for 18 percent of the gross national emissions. It is the third highest emitter after the energy and industry sectors. The growing population necessitates continuous increase in food production while ensuring low carbon footprints of agriculture and livestock. Incidentally, Uttar Pradesh, a prominent state from the IGP region, is also a top agricultural and livestock GHG emitter. This underscores the importance of climate aligned sustainable agricultural practices."
"Understanding Climate Change
 Adaptation for Smallholders/Marginal
 Farmers",UNDP,"Background, Introduction and Methodology","Climate change can have a huge impact across the food processing industry due to its immense dependency on agriculture produce as a raw material. With weather becoming unpredictable, it becomes difficult to foresee industry needs. Climate change and agriculture produce are directly related to the cost of production and hence any risk involved in acquiring agriculture produce will have serious implications on profitability and sustainability of food-based enterprises. Apart from the growers, actors involved in aggregation and collection, transportation and storage, food processors are considered as the value chain actors who add value through a different set of activities. Climate change impacts will occur at all levels of the value chain and individual adaptive responses at each level will either enhance or reduce overall performance in terms of efficiency, continuity and product attributes. This study aims to explore adaptations of small holder farmers with special attention on climate implications and adaptive strategies to value chain actors."
